WHICH TREATS OF THE CASTILIAN NOBILITY, OF THE
LAWS OF MORALITY, OF ALL THAT IS MOST
VENERABLE, AND OTHER SMALL MATTERS.</h2>


<p class="mt3">The crisis through which the house of Telleria was
passing remained unsolved. In fact the catastrophe was
so complete that to try to stem it seemed madness;
nothing could be done but to conceal it as long as possible.
The incorrigible actors in the wretched drama
strained every nerve to prolong their reign before abdicating
disgracefully and retiring into poverty; and
though, behind the scenes, they were forced to soliloquise
on the fact that they had no servants, that there
was not a shop that would trust them, that they had
not the bread of vanity in the form of a carriage, to the
world they made it known that they were all ill. The
marquis, poor man, suffered terribly from rheumatism;
the marquesa&mdash;it was most distressing&mdash;had sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
into an alarming state of debility; the whole family
were depressed and ailing. They received no one, not
even their most intimate friends; they gave no dinners,
not even to the hungry; they went nowhere, not even
to the most interesting first nights.</p>

<p>At church was the only place where they could appear
with such rueful countenances. What can be
more edifying than to listen to the counsels of religion
and to shed a tear at the feet of the Mother of Sorrows.
Poor Milagros! The parishioners, who saw her come
in and go out with a penitent air that was an example
to all, paid her woes the tribute they claimed:</p>

<p>“Poor woman! what a trouble her sons have been
to her!”</p>

<p>The evening meetings at the Marquesa de San
Salomó’s, which were the only refuge of the distressed
family, were very quiet and consisted of one or two
poets, a few handsome women, half a dozen models of
piety and a half a dozen hypocrites. Rome was the
favourite theme of conversation, and “<cite>l’Univers</cite>” the
favourite newspaper; the poets recited verses that exhaled
an odour of sanctity, and under the influence of
this suffocating literary incense the whole human race
was regarded as excommunicated. Gustavo Sudre’s
speeches were discussed beforehand; reputations were
made for youths just come from the seminary: such a
one was a St. Paul, such another a St. Ambrose or a
Tertulian, or an Origen&mdash;in point of talent, of course;
in short the evenings at the San Salomó’s had that
club-like character which is a conspicuous feature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
modern society. Political prejudices have found their
way into the drawing-room and make themselves felt
in the perfumed atmosphere of the boudoir, and more
conspiracies are discussed there than in the barracks.</p>

<p>The marquesa was young, pretty, tall and shapely,
though rather faded looking; her manners were pleasant
and she patronised poetry, especially when it was of
a pious and mystical tone. A sworn foe to materialism
and liberalism and all the evils of modern civilisation,
she was both elegant and clever, and the hours of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tertulias</i> never seemed long; she had the art of spicing
with wit and grace the anathemas that fulminated from
her drawing-room, and she encouraged in her house
and at her table a tone of moderation which was
equally agreeable to the patriarchs and the poets. The
St. Pauls and St. Ambroses no doubt swore to themselves
that asceticism was better to preach than to practise.</p>

<p>The Marquis de San Salomó, a man who would
sooner have been sawn in slices than have yielded a jot
of his opinions&mdash;if indeed he had any&mdash;was not a
frequent figure at these meetings. He more often went
to the theatre, the casino, or other even less mentionable
places of amusement. By day he sat in his study and
received bull-fighters and all the rabble of the arena,
and three-fourths of his conversation consisted of the
slang inseparable from the lowest type of sport, and
stories of the escapades of his boon companions. He
was rich and not only made his wife a handsome allowance
for pin-money, but granted her a considerable sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
for religious purposes, so that a current account with
Heaven formed part of his regular household expenses.
Of his current account with the ladies of the ballet we
need not give the particulars.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day when the marquis had
been to see Leon Roch at Carabanchel his wife was
conversing eagerly with a stiff old gentleman, decorated
with the ribbon of some military order; a most
innocent, harmless creature in spite of his calling, and
one of those soldiers whose existence seems intended to
prove that the army is a perfectly inoffensive body of
men.</p>

<p>“It is vain to try to comfort me, General,” she said.
“I am broken hearted! You yourself have said in exquisite
verses that a mother’s heart is an inexhaustible
treasury of endurance; but mine is full to the brim, I
can endure no more; it must overflow.”</p>

<p>“Then, my dear madam, of what use is your Christian
resignation?” asked the son of Mars, with a look
of innocence worthy of a cherub all head and wings.
“The Lord will vouchsafe unexpected consolations.
And María, is she resigned?”</p>

<p>“What else do you expect from that angel? My
poor child! You might crucify her and she would not
utter a groan. But Heaven always allows its most
saintly children to go through the severest trials. She,
like my adored Luis, only prays the Lord to take her
to Himself; to him He sent physical suffering; to her,
mental anguish.”</p>

<p>“We see every day,” said the general with an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
of horror that sat very funnily on his babyish
face framed in white whiskers, “that scandals, infidelities
and wickedness are on the increase. All laws
human and divine are less and less respected every day.
Where will you find a man of upright character, or a
trace of chivalrous honour? Turn where you will there
is nothing but effrontery and cynicism! Only picture
to yourself, my dear Milagros, what the end must be of
a society which, day by day and hour by hour, neglects
all the principles of religion. But no! I ought not to
say that, for there are still saints and martyrs. Your
daughter for instance, deserted by her husband for her
very virtues, is by those virtues&mdash;by those very virtues
let me repeat&mdash;a shining example, a light, a standard
in the battle.”</p>

<p>Yes, that she certainly was. Every group in the
room was discussing her. Deserted! and solely for
being too good! Such a deed cried to Heaven and
clamoured for vengeance&mdash;a second deluge, the gulf
that yawned to swallow Korah, the fires of Sodom, the
flies of Egypt, the sword of Attila&mdash;of all these curses
the one which seemed most likely to be realised then
and there was that of the flies in Egypt, for their buzzing
and their sting were not inadequately represented
by the spiteful tattle, the commonplace denunciations,
and amateur excommunication with which people of a
certain way of thinking castigate whatever they disapprove
of in their fellow men.</p>

<p>“If the separation had been based on any other
pretext,” said a poet to a journalist, “it might pass ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
for it is an obvious fact that Leon....” But their
voices were lost in a chorus of comments and tittering.
Two old ladies put their noses into the group to inhale
the atmosphere of scandal&mdash;more fragrant to them
than the scent of roses.</p>

<p>“I have suspected it for a long time,” said the mistress
of the house to a deputy who held the archiepiscopal
throne in the ultramontane coterie. “Pepa Fúcar
is a hussy. But there was never more than a crumb of
principle in all the Fúcar household. It does not do to
be too particular in the way you make either money or
love. There are some families that are fated to it.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that the connection is one of old
standing,” replied the deputy, who admired the marquesa’s
dinners, and who was wont to improve on her
slanderous insinuations.</p>

<p>“From what I know now, and from certain dates,”
added Pilar bowing with a reproachful glance to Gustavo
who just then entered the room, “I can positively
assert that they are of very old standing.” And she
continued her remarks in a low tone to the worthy general,
who, though fully determined never to be astonished
at any wickedness could not conceal his dismay
and perplexity.</p>

<p>“Leon’s child!” he muttered.</p>

<p>In another part of the room the Marquis de Telleria
was enlarging on a new&mdash;a perfectly new idea&mdash;with a
ready flow of hackneyed phrases. This was the theory
that we are all monstrously alike; that there are no men
of mark left, and that the world is dismally uniform.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
He&mdash;the marquis&mdash;was in fact fast losing faith in the
traditional chivalry of the Spanish nation.</p>

<p>“Society is fast rushing on its ruin,” the general
agreed, “and though some deluded minds refuse to see
it, it is none the less certain. You have only to observe
one thing, one most significant fact.”</p>

<p>Every one turned to look at the speaker, awaiting
the announcement, which might have been a declaration
of war to judge from the grave truculence of his face.</p>

<p>“Observe, I say, one fact. When there is any
scandal, or rumour of a scandal, who gives rise to it?
Mark, I say, who gives rise to it. It is always a man
devoid of religion; one of those conceited and infatuated
beings who dare to despise the Christian faith, and
who may be seen every day flaunting their insolence,
and lifting their heads to defy the stars.”</p>

<p>This speech was received with the silence of grave
consent; then a question arose between the deputy and
the journalist as to whether Leon sinned from indifference
or from perversity.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt of it,” said the deputy, “corruption
is universal. But while those who cling to the faith
are in a position to amend and save their souls, the
rationalists are going on straight to ruin. Like Samson,
they have pulled the temple about their ears, and, like
him, they must perish in the ruins.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gustavo and the Marquesa de San
Salomó were talking together in too low a voice to be
overheard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>“You ought&mdash;you must,” she said. “Tell the
whole truth to María.”</p>

<p>“The truth? But I cannot trust to appearances. I
have not at all made up my mind as to Leon’s guilt.
Until I have seen him and talked to him I shall say
nothing to my sister.”</p>

<p>“Then I will.”</p>

<p>“No, you will not.”</p>

<p>The lady was fractiously eager; she felt as though
she could not breathe freely till she had sent the arrow
home to her friend’s heart.</p>

<p>“But I assure you I will,” she said, with dilated
nostrils, sparkling eyes and a mounting colour.</p>

<p>“In matters that concern my family the decision
must be left to them.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I have a voice too in matters which concern
your family,” said the marquesa with an impertinent accent
on the words “your family.”</p>

<p>“Never, with my consent,” retorted Gustavo, repressing
his indignation. He was pale, and his whole expression
was that of a man who had worries of his own.
Pilar raised her voice.</p>

<p>“Our friend here&mdash;the father of his country&mdash;tells
me that he cannot make his speech to-morrow on the
subject of article twenty-two.” There was a murmur
of dissatisfaction. “The president has allowed him to
exchange his turn.”</p>

<p>“When will it be then?”</p>

<p>“This sad business of his sister’s,” she went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
looking at Gustavo with assumed sympathy. “Has
been too much for his brain.”</p>

<p>Gustavo went across to where his mother was sitting.</p>

<p>“Compose yourself,” she said affectionately, “we
are as miserable as you can be, but we have not lost
patience.”</p>

<p>“Ah well, I have.”</p>

<p>“But have you made any effort to verify the truth
of this report about Leon,” asked the deputy who gave
himself the airs of a whole convocation.</p>

<p>“Oh there is no lack of dates. Agustin went to
see him to-day ... he tried to bring him to a sense of
duty....” And the conversation still ran on this absorbing
subject till presently the group was diminished
by several persons moving off to hear the mistress of the
house read an article by Louis Veuillot. Gustavo and
his mother went into an adjoining room.</p>

<p>“Is it true that my father went to-day to see
Leon?”</p>

<p>“You heard me say so.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid that his journey to Carabanchel might
have had another object. It would be a fresh disgrace....”</p>

<p>“What nonsense! Disgrace! You are a perfect Don
Quixote!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Gustavo with a glare of wrath in his
eyes, “I am afraid he went to throw himself at the feet
of our enemy and to beg of him....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>“What shocking things you say! We, we, beg of
him!”</p>

<p>“Oh! that would not astonish me; I am accustomed
to shocking things. I will go to see Leon and
talk to him myself. Who knows but that he may
not be so guilty as we think. Horrible lies are invented
in the world and it is quite certain that all are
not good who are supposed to be. Others on the contrary&mdash;if
he has really deserted my sister to live with
another woman all intercourse between us and him
must cease; he must be a stranger to us. Oh! what a
shame it is&mdash;what misery&mdash;to have received from such
a man so many favours that we cannot throw back in
his teeth!”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! do not speak like that, you will
attract attention,” cried the marquesa alarmed by her
son’s vehemence. “You are really absurd!”</p>

<p>“Absurd!” repeated Gustavo bitterly. “What do I
care; and after all I am the only one of the family who
feels the vileness of our existence.”</p>

<p>“Gustavo!”</p>

<p>“I speak for myself, only for myself. This house is
as odious to me as my own home. The everlasting babble
about morality has deafened me and prevents my
hearing the voice of truth&mdash;truth, which the more it is
felt the less it is talked about. I am equally disgusted
with my own part in the world, with the position of my
family, and the worldly cynical set who call themselves
my friends. I am satisfied with nothing, and the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
thing I hope for, is a voluntary exile that may remove
me from all who belong to me.”</p>

<p>“And do you wish to add fresh troubles to those I
already have to bear?” she said, visibly moved. “You,
emigrate, renounce all your future prospects&mdash;even the
hope of becoming a minister....”</p>

<p>“No, the idea of emigrating is, of course, mere
madness; I cannot go. My ambition and my disgrace
are one and I am bound to them as the snail is to his
shell. Here I must stay&mdash;for ever inseparable from my
family, my fancy, my class, and my principles!” He
accented the last word ironically. “I must live on,
seeing what I see, and hearing what I hear. By the way,
I have a new disaster to tell you of. This evening
Polito was slapped in the face, in a house I need not
name, in consequence of a dispute over a game of
cards. There was a fight, women screamed&mdash;the police
interfered....”</p>

<p>“But was he hurt?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;a bruise or two; but the row was heard all
down the street&mdash;no matter the name of the street;”
he groaned and went on: “We live in an evil day, a
day of wrath! However, from this time forth I shall
insist on managing the affairs of the house, and we shall
see whether I can get it out of the present difficulty,
and save our credit at any rate&mdash;save the honour
which is no longer a fact but a fiction. I am deeply
vexed that my father should have gone to Leon with
the purpose that I suspect.”</p>

<p>“It is an absurd suspicion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nay&mdash;it is a miracle if I am mistaken. But I will
know the truth, for I will see Leon.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes I. I must know his guilt from himself. I believe
him to be in error, but not in wilful sin; I will talk
to him frankly and he will answer me in the same way.
If he is such a wretch he will have to confess it ...
meanwhile be sure you do not let a word of these reports
reach María’s ears.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I shall tell her myself; poor child! It would
be a pity that she should not know all the virtues of her
loving husband! Fancy if a stranger were to tell her,
exaggerating or misrepresenting the facts.”</p>

<p>“Say nothing about it to her.”</p>

<p>“Do not interfere in that matter. I shall, and this
very night. You need not teach me my duties as an
affectionate and anxious mother; I know perfectly well
what I ought to do. María must be informed of everything.
How do you know that we may not arrange a
reconciliation?”</p>

<p>Gustavo was on the point of replying when their
privacy was invaded by a certain poet who was said to
be very attentive to the marquesa and one of her favourite
followers&mdash;a common, clumsy-looking man, but
older than he seemed. There was no trace in his features
of that lofty refinement which might have entitled
him to write, in a dozen different metres, of the perennial
founts of gladness and the mystical union of souls,
or to proclaim his indignation against those who denied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
or ignored the existence of God. It was hard to credit
so despicable a person with magnanimity.</p>

<p>“It is admirable, unanswerable!” he exclaimed as
he came in.</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>“Louis Veuillot’s article on modern society&mdash;on
those base and corrupt minds who, to smother their own
remorse, wish to abolish faith. Do you want this copy
of the <cite>Univers</cite>, Gustavo?”</p>

<p>“You can take it if you will let me have it to-morrow.
I have an article to write on the same subject.”</p>

<p>They went into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Then it is understood we sing to-morrow,” said
the marquesa to her friend.</p>

<p>“Yes, to-morrow, without fail.” There was a rustling
of silk dresses, a chorus of: “To-morrow then, to-morrow&mdash;”
a chirping of kisses and moving of chairs.
The company were dispersing. Some left in pairs:
some went smiling, others frowning. The Tellerias departed,
then the general, and the deputy with his archiepiscopal
airs; and with him went Gustavo, discussing
church politics but without losing his expression of
gloom.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Pilar; to-morrow at San Prudencio.”</p>

<p>“Good-night&mdash;I will take your message to Padre
Paoletti.”</p>

<p>And when they were all gone the Marquesa de San
Salomó retired to pray and to sleep.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_II">CHAPTER II.<br />

A PICTURE WHICH MIGHT BE ZURBARAN BUT IS ONLY
BY GOYA.</h2>


<p class="mt3">María de Roch was very early at church next
morning. For some time past she had accustomed
herself to rise early and perform her religious duties so
as to return home by nine o’clock, by which plan she
avoided meeting the crowd of worshippers who selected
the more convenient hours of the day. On this particular
day, being Sunday, she was even earlier than
usual and came out of church having fulfilled the duties
that most flattered her soul; then, as usual, she spent
the chief part of the morning in religious reading. But
she did not seek mental nourishment in the rich stores
of the older mystical literature of Spain&mdash;writings purified
in the crucible of the loftiest spiritual faith and
which are a real feast for the faithful soul, warming it
with a divine flame and edifying it with transcendental
poetry and morality. María fed her piety,
sad to say, on the worst of contemporary religious
literature, the outcome, in many cases, of ecclesiastical
jobbery&mdash;in style a borrowed medley and in
substance not really religious at all, but materialistic in
its tendencies&mdash;which, with newspapers and prayer-books,
forms the staple of the booksellers’ trade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Many of these effusions are translated from the French
and bear a “made to sell” stamp which is little short
of profane. Their covers do not lack the elegance and
finish characteristic of good modern workmanship;
within lie prose and verse. But what prose! What
verse! There are certain ideas which demand simplicity
of expression; it is their natural garb, without
which they cease to exist; there are others which require
dignity and grandeur, and which, lacking these,
degenerate into affectation and rhodomontade. María
could not appreciate these subtleties; her favourite
works were full of “celestial smiles” and “seraphic
fires,” of “virgin souls” and “airs from Heaven.”
This sensual terminology appealed to her more directly
than any other language; her narrow intelligence
would not have understood any other or would have
despised it, for her imagination was particularly susceptible
to the suggestions of her senses. María admired
the character of Santa Teresa because she had
been taught to do so, but she could not understand her
sublime metaphysics. Seraphic fervour was to her a
flow of words or it was nothing. She did not exhaust
her brain by trying to conceive of the subtler forms of
devotion, nor was she capable of sublime abstractions.
Her nature, with its plain common-sense, was coarse,
and led her to seek religious fervour by other means.
For instance, God’s mercy to his creatures was to her
a fact beyond dispute, but it only came home to her
personally as associated with some relic; the infinite
perfection of the Creator, though she believed in it implicitly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
was real to her apprehension only through the
æsthetic medium of an image. The Virgin Mary, the
ideal which of all others most interpenetrates the heart
of a woman, did not fail to appeal to hers; but yet in
order to feel her influence in full force, to be wrought
to enthusiasm or moved to tears, she would steep&mdash;or
shall I say dilute? her emotions in water from
Lourdes.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show that María’s religion
was that of the lower orders&mdash;meaning by low, incapable
of thought and feeling, and leading that mechanical
existence of eating, digesting and sleeping, which is
the crassest and purest materialism. Vulgarity is not a
class distinction; it is an element, a component, a
chemical constituent of social geology; if a map could
be constructed to show its distribution it would appear
as a black stain&mdash;a foul deposit&mdash;in every stratum of
humanity. And thus, just as a few elect spirits represent
the aristocracy of mind, María was the representative
of vulgar credulity. In other times and under
other conditions, without ceasing to profess piety or to
pray six hours a day, she would have told fortunes by
the cards, have worked witchcraft by means of relics
and rosaries, and have mixed up her religious exercises
with the tricks and arts of a gipsy.</p>

<p>But these are things of the past, though there are
still malignant souls in the world and gipsy arts and
wiles, differing, it is true from those of the middle ages.
María’s aim and end was to belong to every religious
society, charitable or otherwise. She was, more especially,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
what in the jargon of cant is known as a
“<i>Josephina</i>,” affiliated, that is to say, to a society
named after St. Joseph, whose principal object is to send
up prayers for the Pope. It includes a large number
of highly respectable persons of whom no ridicule is intended.
María was a member of various other associations
and sisterhoods; nearly all of them have their
periodical reports and tracts, intended to consolidate
their existence and to supply a form of light literature
which is sometimes extraordinarily droll to the outsider.
María accepted it all as unctuous and edifying and
would spend hours in reading the stories&mdash;would that
we could reproduce a few of them!&mdash;and addresses;
and above all the section which may be called “Mystico-pathological:”
the list, that is to say, of the cures
effected every month by the wafers and ointments
dipped in the famous “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Perolito</i>” of Seville&mdash;miracles
even greater than those wrought by Holloway and
other quacks. María had always by her a store of
these medicaments for the benefit of her friends and relations,
being absolutely convinced of their efficacy on
those who employed them in faith. The “Perolito”
could never be a paying concern in any country where
common-sense and an efficient police were known.
Though María constantly aimed at treading in the footsteps
of her brother Luis she was free from his extravagant
ecstasy, and her ideas and practice were unlike his
in many particulars. Her unhealthy pietism was the outcome
of a narrow intellect, and kept alive by her senses
and the refractory pride of her nature. Her ideas and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
feelings were absolutely foreign to those of her husband,
and we have seen what the character of her affection
for him was&mdash;the only affection of which she was capable&mdash;and
in her hours of penitential solitude how she
had struggled to eradicate even that! What violence
she had done to her imagination in trying to see as evil,
what was good, as corrupt, what was worthy, as repulsive,
what was noble and attractive! She firmly believed
that so long as she allowed her mind to dwell on
the image of her husband she was no true saint. Was
she right or wrong? None can tell but God who, in
his omniscience, saw the aspect that image wore.</p>

<p>“If only he were not an atheist!” was her constant
thought; and the response was an implacable determination
never to have anything in common with such
a man. In thought she referred to that brother whose
shade would visit her in the lonely watches of the night
and it had been his wish&mdash;his will&mdash;that she and the
atheist should live separated; he had pronounced her
free from her matrimonial bondage and released her from
the burden of earthly duty, that she might henceforth
belong solely to God. And now and again she would
start from sleep in an agony of distress, her forehead
damp with sweat, and trembling in every limb. “And
if he loves some other woman!” she would mutter to
herself.</p>

<p>Her ideas had taken this turn. She could even bear
to think that her husband might die without loving her,
but that he should live and love some one else&mdash;that
he should give to another that which ought to be hers.&mdash;That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
was her real grief and constant mortification;
and when her reflections reached this point her whole
being leaped into revolt with an impulse which was the
very passion of egotism.</p>

<p>During the period when Leon was gradually becoming
estranged from her María took a delight in humiliating
him; it was a pleasure to see him come in every
evening, ready to receive the lash. Nay, sometimes,
from the force of habit and from the sincere regard
which he had inspired in her, she was really glad at his
coming but she took care to conceal both the gladness
and the affection. Merciful Heaven! It would never
do to let it be said that she hailed and welcomed the
“Atheist.” Secretly she took an interest in everything
that concerned him, gave orders for his comfort, and if
he were ailing, made him take advice and remedies, only
taking care not to give him water from the Grotto at
Lourdes or wafer from Seville as these are specific
only for those who believe in them.</p>

<p>When they talked to each other it cost her a constant
effort to keep herself from gazing with pleasure
and sympathy on her husband’s attractive face, and
when she was alone, she repented of her weakness,
calling herself reprobate and sensual and imploring her
brother in Heaven to aid her by the virtue of certain
sacred relics.&mdash;“But if only he were not an atheist!”
And she would weep at the thought.</p>

<p>When Leon left her once for all, María who had
clenched the matter by declaring that God forbid her
to love him, felt utterly crushed; her hearth was vacant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and desolate. She was terrified too&mdash;of what? She
herself knew not. During one whole night she could
not command her mind to a single thought of devotion.
She was stunned, but at the same time her brain ached
with a swarm of evil visions like the trampling of horses
snorting as they charge. She needed much reading and
all the counsel and warnings of her spiritual directors
before she could fairly bury the fair corpse of her departed
happiness; much prayer, much penance, much
labour of her fancy to see what she knew to be good
and beautiful as evil and hideous. But she was not the
first to undertake this odious task of purifying her soul
by the instrumentality of the imagination&mdash;heaping
foulness over the grave of all the joys of love and
graces of life; hermits and ascetics had done it before
her, and filled up the measure by personal castigation.
María laboured in the obscurity of her tortured brain to
see the happy days of her honeymoon in the darkest
and foulest colours and so threw a lurid light on the sweetest
hours of her married life.&mdash;It was a frightful revulsion
and anarchy of soul.</p>

<p>As has been said, María, when her husband was absent
for ever felt a miserable void, anxiety and solitude.
Where was he gone? She made various enquiries, but
without betraying her disquietude. She profaned even
her prayers by thinking of it&mdash;San Antonio! but this
man was hers&mdash;her husband and should belong to no
one else!</p>

<p>Logic of this kind comes with fulminating force
sometimes to a half-demented brain; and the strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
thing was that in spite of what she choose to call Leon’s
atheism, she had always recognised in him a basis of
honourable feeling in which she had perfect confidence.
Still, so narrow was her apprehension, that she had
never thought of setting that magnanimity against his
disbelief. Why did she trust the honour of an atheist?
She did not know, but that she did was beyond dispute.
Now, when her husband, her mate, her companion, had
left her, she was bereft of all trust. María was going
through a strange experience. It seemed to be close to
her, a monstrous and hideous presence that gazed at
her, that haunted her, that glided with a cold and slimy
touch up the pleats of her dress, looked into her heart
with its wicked black eyes, poked in its taper head, and
then drew in its long writhing body to the very tip of
its slender tail&mdash;curled itself up in her heart where it
lay coiled, radiating an intolerable heat but as still and
motionless as death in the nest that it had made there.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_III">CHAPTER III.<br />

THE REVOLUTION.</h2>


<p class="mt3">The Marquesa de San Salomó was talking to María.</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” she began, “I would not be the
last to come and condole with you.”</p>

<p>“To pray with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to pray; but also to sympathise. I did not
see you in church. Padre Paoletti told me that you
had come and gone early; and I quite understood it.
I long to talk to you and comfort you....”</p>

<p>“Comfort me?” said María much puzzled, “for my
loneliness, my solitude ... but I have suffered long in
silence, and the Lord has not denied me sweet consolation.
What are we here for but to suffer? We
have only to get that well into our minds and then no
grief can find us unprepared.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Pilar with eager admiration and kissing
her friend, “how good you are! What a saint!
What a beautiful exception in this wretched world!
Folks ought to come and worship you and pray to you
as much as if you were canonized.”</p>

<p>“No, no, you are wrong, very wrong. What if I
were to tell you that I am dreadfully wicked?”</p>

<p>“You, wicked! you?” said Pilar looking as horrified
as if the idea were rank blasphemy. “And if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
are a sinner what am I? Tell me that.... What am
I?” and she answered the question herself with a deep
and prolonged sigh, the pathetic expression of a conscience
that was too heavily laden. “It would be a
marvel to me that there should be any saints, even if
the occasions of sin were rare, and half the world lived
in convents or in caves, setting each other a good example;
but now, when liberty has multiplied the opportunities
of vice, and every one does as he pleases, and
there is hardly any one to set a worthy example, it is
miraculous. That is why I say that you ought to be
canonized; for in Madrid, which is beyond a doubt the
wickedest place under the sun&mdash;and in this century
which, as Padre Paoletti says, is the opprobrium of the
ages&mdash;you have been able to defy the temptations
of the world and are worthy to be compared with the
penitents, and confessors, and even the martyrs of the
Church.” She emphasised the last words with marked
meaning.</p>

<p>“Oh! do not speak so,” said María who though
she liked flattery was wont to conceal the fact.</p>

<p>“My dear, I think you admirable, wonderful,”
added her friend with affectionate rapture. “For I am
miles behind you though I long to be like you. Would
that Heaven might grant me to take a single step alone
and unhindered in the path of perfection in which you
are treading, and on which I have not even started!
Do you know what I should like? To be constantly
with you, to go to pray with you, if you would allow it,
to read what you read, to think as you think; and see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
whether in that way I should feel better inspired. For
the present I will only ask you to give me something
belonging to you&mdash;anything, a handkerchief for instance,
that I may always wear it in my bosom as if it
were a relic. I want always to touch something that
you have touched. I would never be without it, because
when I see your handkerchief it will remind me
of you and of your goodness, and that will help me to
conquer an evil thought or a bad impulse. Admire
you? And ought I not admire you, dear angel? Indeed,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma petite</i>, you do not know your own value. You
will see, when you die people will fight for pieces of
your garments.”</p>

<p>“Pilar, you are offending Heaven by your adulation!”</p>

<p>“It is only that you are so good that you do not
like to hear it. Your brother in glory was just the
same, but you are better than he.”</p>

<p>“Pilar, for God’s sake!” cried María, now really
horrified.</p>

<p>“Yes, and greater than he; I say so. He was a
saint but you are a martyr as well. You have reached
the climax of Christian heroism. I know no living
creature to compare with you, and I do not know
whether to admire or to pity you most.”</p>

<p>María did not understand her.</p>

<p>“The name of saint seems to me too weak&mdash;and
what name of horror can I give to the man who,
having in his house such a treasure of goodness and
piety, abandoned it, despised it and covered himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
with ignominy by scorning gold for base metal, and
filling the place of the angel Heaven had granted him
for a wife with a....”</p>

<p>“Pilar! Good God! Are you speaking of my
husband?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dearest friend,” said the marquesa, colouring
with excitement, “forgive me for being furious as I
speak of it. I really cannot help it!”</p>

<p>“But Leon.... Pilar, you do not know what you
are saying; my husband is a strictly moral man.”</p>

<p>It has been said that María was a woman of limited
intellect though of fairly strong feelings; her nature
lacked delicacy and refinement, but, at the same time,
what was best in her was a basis of loyalty and honour
and a vein of innate rectitude which is always accompanied
by a certain confidence in the honesty of others.
Her friend’s reticent insinuations aroused her indignation.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Pilar, “that I have been very rash
and indiscreet. You have heard nothing.”</p>

<p>“I have heard nothing? What about?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I cannot tell you; I ought to have held my
tongue. I thought that your mother....”</p>

<p>“Speak out&mdash;you mentioned my husband....”</p>

<p>“And now I am sorry for it.”</p>

<p>“Then my husband&mdash;then you mean to say&mdash;he
believes in nothing&mdash;there is no hope for his soul&mdash;he
is an atheist, an infidel ... but he is perfectly well conducted
and blameless in his life....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Pilar suddenly burst out laughing; her loud and
impertinent mirth, lasting for some seconds, disturbed
María beyond measure.</p>

<p>“If you call it blameless to desert his wife, who is a
saint, and live with another ...” said her friend, in a
sharp rough tone like that of a file on metal. María
turned as pale as death, her eyes staring and her lips
parted.</p>

<p>“With another!” The idea was not a new one,
but the fact was a shock. She had anticipated the revelation
by vague and timid suspicions; but a sad truth
startles us even when it has been foreseen in a terrible
dream. “With another, you said?”</p>

<p>“Yes, with another. All Madrid knows it but you.”</p>

<p>“You said&mdash;with another ...” repeated María
who had half lost her wits and stood stunned and paralysed
as though those two terrible words were a mass
of stone that had fallen on her head.</p>

<p>“Yes, with another,” said Pilar, with another burst
of laughter, which did not argue any very great reverence
for the saint of her adoration.</p>

<p>“And who is it?” asked María with a flash of vehemence,
her bewilderment suddenly changed to passionate
excitement. “Who, I say, who?”</p>

<p>“I thought you knew, poor martyr! It is Pepa
Fúcar, the daughter of the Marquis de Fúcar; the
man whom all the papers call ‘the eminent Fúcar,’
because he has made a fortune by paving streets,
laying down railroads, poisoning the country with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
his tobacco&mdash;which is made they say of dead leaves
swept off the roads, and finally lending money to
the government during the war, at two hundred per
cent; a specimen man of the century, with a Haytian
title; a product of parliamentary influence and work
done by contract. He cannot bear the sight of me because,
one evening at the Rioponces’, he began paying
me compliments and I turned my back on him, and
whenever I see him within hearing in a drawing-room
I begin talking of the adulteration of tobacco, of the increase
of asphalt pavements, of the nuisance of gas, and
of the shoes with brown paper soles that he supplied to
the troops.” And Pilar laughed sharply for the third
time.</p>

<p>But María had not listened to her spiteful sketch of
the Marquis de Fúcar. She heard nothing but the tumult
in her own soul, the storm of a rebellion, of a revolution,
like the stormy rousing of a sleeping crowd.
The serpent that lay brooding in her heart suddenly
brought forth a swarm of others that started into life,
alert and vicious, gnawing, and vomiting fire. Her
jealousy took the form of a legion of invisible reptiles,
stinging and scorching her on every side; this was in
fact the guise under which it presented itself to her imagination,
which always conceived of mental experiences
as analogous to physical sensations; to her a
pleasure was actually a caress, and a pain a blow or a
pinch or a stab. The poor saint and martyr had never
in her life before felt anything like this, and she did not
know what it meant. Her grief was compounded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
terror and surprise, and the shock was so great that she
forgot to turn to God, as might have seemed natural,
or to pray for patience or resignation.</p>

<p>What was this? It was the Real suppressing the
Artificial; the woman’s heart asserting its supremacy
through the agency of a revolt of its imprisoned, but
genuine, emotions. It was an entire revolution of
woman’s nature claiming its rights, and throwing off all
that was false and assumed to raise the triumphant standard
of truth and of that nobler part which&mdash;whether
she be lover, wife, or mother, good or bad&mdash;makes her
a true woman; makes her the other half of man&mdash;the
Eve to Adam&mdash;whether faithful or faithless, a heroine
or a baggage. This revolution is sometimes occasioned
by the passion of love; but not invariably, because
love in its innocent simplicity yields to the sophistries
and treacherous blandishments of its brother mysticism.
What never fails to stir it up is the brutal and overwhelming
passion of jealousy, so well painted by Calderon
as the hydra whose double nature, diabolical and
seraphical, betrays its birth as the hybrid offspring of
Love, which is divine, and Envy, the daughter of all
the devils. The sudden frenzy that had sprung up in
María’s soul was more akin to its mother Envy than to
its father Love. It was an instrument of torture and
torment, a rack without respite, a fire that grew fiercer
each instant. Her bigotry was suddenly shattered like
a tower that has been undermined and blown to the
winds. At that moment her soul was dark; God utterly
eclipsed. With a cry of anguish and clasping her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
head in her hands she exclaimed: “Wretch! But you
shall pay dearly for it!”</p>

<p>Just at this juncture her mother entered the room
and perceiving that María had learnt all, she threw herself
into her arms. María had no tears; her eyes were
dry and sparkling. The marquesa puckered her face up
to shed a tear she had ready, as we are prepared with
sighs as we enter the house of death.</p>

<p>“Do not suppress your grief, my darling child. I
see you know the worst. I would not have told you
for fear of agitating your tender soul ... be calm. Pilar
has told you? It is horrible, atrocious! but perhaps
not irremediable.... For days I have been miserable;
but be calm; let me see you resigned.”</p>

<p>Pilar thought it was her turn to speak again.</p>

<p>“The atrocity,” she said, “is all the greater under
the circumstances. It is a villainous thing to betray any
woman, but a saint like you.... What is society coming
to? In its passion for abolishing it will at last abolish
the soul! Oh! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est dégoutant</i>! and then the wretches
wonder that a handful of brave men stand forth, determined
that God shall not be pensioned off. They
are furious because a standard is raised to rally those
who are ready to do battle for Religion, the Mother of
Duty. If they are conquered through treachery, which
nowadays triumphs everywhere, they will return to the
charge ... they will return again and again, till at
last....”</p>

<p>As she spoke she had risen, and was now standing
in front of a mirror that formed the door of a wardrobe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and contemplating her interesting person, twisting from
side to side to study the fall of her elegant mantle and
the effect of her fashionable hat. Her dainty, ungloved
hands arranged here a pleat and there a curl; and then
she returned to her seat.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that he is living there?” said the
marquesa to her daughter and softening the words with
a kiss.</p>

<p>“With her?” cried María drawing aside from her
mother’s embrace. “Where?”</p>

<p>“At Carabanchel. Leon was so reckless as to take
a lodging close to Suertebella. There is a way through
the park.”</p>

<p>“I will go there,” said María rising and pulling violently
at the bell.</p>

<p>“My dear, be calm. You must not take it so.”</p>

<p>A maid answered the bell and María said: “My
black dress.”</p>

<p>“Your black merino frock!” exclaimed her mother.
“A pretty object you will look! No, no, if you go at
all&mdash;and we will talk of that&mdash;you must dress as well
and look as handsome and as nice as possible.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” cried María regretfully. “I have no
gowns; nothing pretty or nice; I have given all my
good things away.”</p>

<p>“And you think you can go in that merino rag?
Foolish child! how little you know of men. Very well;
go to find your husband a perfect guy, and you will
see how much he cares. Nay, appearances rule the
world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>“But first let us decide whether you had better go
at all,” suggested Pilar.</p>

<p>“Yes, I want to go ... I want to go,” María insisted,
clasping her hands, and her eyes glared with
fury.</p>

<p>“No tragedies, no scenes&mdash;eh?”</p>

<p>“I do not think it is safe for you to go there.
If he were to offer you some grosser insult, if you were
to meet Pepa face to face, or her child&mdash;supposing that
the child is in its father’s arms&mdash;for they say he is devoted
to it....”</p>

<p>“Its father?” said María “Why Federico is
dead?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said her friend, with the expression of
cruel resolve that she might have put on while thrusting
a needle through some wretched insect to add it to a
collection. “No, do you not see? Your husband ...”</p>

<p>“Leon ... my husband ... Monina’s father!” exclaimed
the poor woman. The fresh blow stunned her
as the first had done.</p>

<p>“So the people choose to say,” said Milagros trying
to soften the shock.</p>

<p>“And you, Mamma, what do you think? Is it true?”
asked María with great anxiety.</p>

<p>These two women were not malicious; their state
of mind&mdash;analogous to that state of the body which is
known to physicians as cachexy&mdash;was the result of a
lack of sound principle from moral impoverishment, a
disease caused by the life they led and the constant infection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of an atmosphere full of deceptions and scandal.
Still, there was something in them that made them revolt
at their own cruelty; horrified at the depth and
bitterness of the cup they had put to María’s lips, they
now attempted to qualify it.</p>

<p>“No, I believe it is a fable.”</p>

<p>“No, I believe....” But Pilar, who was less generous
than her friend, did not finish her sentence.</p>

<p>“The idea arose,” she added, “from a certain likeness....”</p>

<p>“In Monina?”</p>

<p>“To Leon&mdash;I do not know what to think. It
seems to me beyond a doubt that the connection is of
old standing.”</p>

<p>María bounced from her chair; there is no other
word for that spring, like a stag’s when wounded in his
sleep, and she rushed to seize the black merino gown in
order to start at once.</p>

<p>“Do not be precipitate, do not be rash,” said her
mother, detaining her. “You cannot go at this time of
day. It is quite dusk.”</p>

<p>“What does that matter?”</p>

<p>“No, you really must not.”</p>

<p>The evening had in fact come down on them and
the room was almost dark. “Lights&mdash;bring lights!”
cried María, “I cannot bear this gloom.”</p>

<p>“I think that you ought to go,” her mother went
on; “but not to-night, to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Marquesa, have you fully considered the step?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>”
asked her friend. “Will it not be a humiliation; would
not silent contempt be more dignified?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the affectionate and anxious mother;
“I even hope for a reconciliation.”</p>

<p>In truth her hopes were small, but it was what she
most ardently desired.</p>

<p>“A reconciliation! what madness! And you, María,
do you believe in a reconciliation?”</p>

<p>“I, I do not know, I cannot tell,” said María, helpless
to answer that or any other question. “I do not
ask for reconciliation but for punishment.”</p>

<p>“Oh! my dear, we are not acting a melodrama,”
cried the marquesa spreading out her hands with the
affected solemnity of a white-robed priest on the opera
stage. “Peace, peace! be calm María; yes you must
go, and go dressed like other folks. That smell of dyed
woolen ... pah! it is intolerable.”</p>

<p>The two marquesas laughed at the jest, while Pilar
threw the objectionable garment aside. María glanced
at it revengefully as much as to say: “Why are you
not silk, and well made, and fashionable?”</p>

<p>For the first time since she had renounced worldly
things the plain uniform of sanctity, which yesterday
she would not have exchanged for royal robes, struck
her as ugly.</p>

<p>“The question of dress will be easily solved,” said
Pilar, “you and I are much alike in figure; I will
bring some of my gowns for you to choose from.”</p>

<p>“And a mantle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a hat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>“At what time will you start?”</p>

<p>“At once.”</p>

<p>“No, to-morrow at noon,” said the mother, “we
must not neglect the proprieties&mdash;the proper time and
opportunity.”</p>

<p>“I must go home to dinner, and I will return afterwards,”
said Pilar. “I will bring you what I have that
is most suitable, for you to choose from. We will make
you quite beautiful. The worst thing that could happen
would be for Pepa Fúcar to laugh at you for
fun. I shall be back again in an hour and a half; we
have no one coming to see us this evening, and my husband
is dining out with Higadillos and some other bull-fighters,
and a couple of deputies. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir</i>, my dear&mdash;good-night,
Milagros.” She kissed them both and
disappeared.</p>

<p>During her absence the marquesa ate a little dinner;
María none, though there was no fast enjoined by the
church almanac. Pilar by-and-bye returned with a carriage-load
of elegant raiment&mdash;beautiful dresses, mantles,
parasols, hats; and that nothing might be wanting
she even brought boots of the latest make and silk
stockings <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haute nouveauté</i>. This was the sack-cloth worn
by this coquettish votary of the faith!</p>

<p>The servants and the maid brought everything up
and the sofas and chairs were covered. Pilar, who was
a capital show-woman told them to place this gown
here, and that hat there, so as to display them to the
best advantage. María sat gazing seriously enough at
the gay colours, the wonderful shapes and whimsical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
decorations devised by French milliners. She looked,
but she did not seem to see.</p>

<p>“Well what do you think? Which dress will you
wear?”</p>

<p>“This is pretty,” said María pointing at one at random.
“Who made it for you?” And then again she
sat gloomily staring before her. She was like a reveller
who has been long absent and is astonished to find the
fashions changed.</p>

<p>“What a tight shape!” she said.</p>

<p>“This pearl-grey will suit you.”</p>

<p>“No, I would rather wear black,” she said.</p>

<p>“That black corded silk with pale straw colour.
That suits you to perfection; I admire your taste
though the season is not far advanced it is hot. Which
hat will you have?”</p>

<p>María looked at three hats that Pilar displayed.
After long meditation she said: “That black one with&mdash;what
do you call that colour&mdash;cream? and the bird
is pretty too with those pale roses.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Pilar admiringly, “if you had not
given up the world for more than a single day you
could not do better. How well you have chosen. Very
well, now you shall try them on. We must see if the
gown fits you; it can be taken in, or let out; I brought
my maid, and between us ...”</p>

<p>Before María could say a word her mother, Pilar,
and the maid had begun to divest her of the coarse
grey flannel dress which looked like the gown of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
poverty-stricken priestling. But at this proceeding
María felt a slight reaction.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” she cried, “what are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Silly, silly child,” said the marquesa, “even at such
a crisis can you not forget the follies of your exaggerated
devotion?”</p>

<p>María allowed herself to be led into the next room
and in front of a looking-glass; but the mirror was
covered with a black curtain and looked more like a
catafalque. They pulled it aside, and in the glass was
born, as one might say, the charming image of María
Sudre&mdash;a sudden creation as it seemed in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Good Heavens!” she exclaimed, clasping her
hands, “how thin I am!”</p>

<p>“Yes a little fallen away, but prettier, much prettier
than ever,” said her mother enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Lovely, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">charmante</i>!... Juana, come and dress
this hair,” said Pilar to the maid, who was famous as
a hair-dresser.</p>

<p>“Be clever now; something simple. Just a knot
that we may judge of the effect of the hat.”</p>

<p>Juana quickly unfastened María’s plaits to begin
her work, while María, after looking at herself for a few
minutes, fixed her eyes on her lap and seemed to be
praying in silence. She had seen her marble shoulders
and snowy throat and the sight had filled her with conscientious
alarms. Perhaps the reaction might have
spurred her to resistance. If an arrow shot from her
mother’s well-aimed bow had not diverted her thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>“When I look at you, my darling, it is incredible
to me how that red-haired Pepa Fúcar....”</p>

<p>María’s jealousy started her into life again as a jaded
horse is roused by the spur. Her eyes flashed as they
saw themselves in the glass. “How lovely God has
made us!” they seemed to say. She turned her head
from side to side, looking out of the corner of her eye
to see as much as she could of her profile. Yes, it was
a fair vision! her paleness was becoming; she might
have been taken for a convalescent love-sick angel.</p>

<p>In no time at all Juana had dressed her hair high,
so perfectly becoming to María’s face and shape that
the most famous coiffeur could have done no better;
it was hailed with an exclamation of surprise, and María
herself gazed in admiration, though she could not smile.
Then, having induced her to return to the room where
stood a large pier glass, they dressed her in a long
princess gown, not an easy operation now that her hair
was done.</p>

<p>“Oh! how handsome she is! odious creature,”
cried the owner of the garment with a pinch of envy.
“Now the mantle; we will try this cashmere wrap with
embroidery and a fringe. It was made by a disciple of
Worth’s.”</p>

<p>María obeyed blindly, allowing herself to be dressed,
watching the process in the glass with anxious eyes, and
involuntarily giving herself the moods and attitudes
which were needed. The maid held up the light to
show the charming picture.</p>

<p>“Now for the hat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the finishing touch, and Pilar would trust
no hands but her own with the delicate task. It was
like crowning a queen. She lifted the hat and placed
it carefully on her friend’s head. What a result! what
a success! what a triumph of the æsthetic arts! María
was dressed. Complete and perfect in fashion and style!
A fashion plate of flesh! Indeed, as she stood, she
seemed the ideal and type of good taste; of that perfection
of dress combined with the perfection of beauty
which produce those distracting charms to which the
prudence, the dignity, and sometimes the wealth and
salvation of men are sacrificed. Alas! poor Adam! to
think that there was a time when for full-dress you had
only to pluck a leaf from the first fig-tree!</p>

<p>“Now I am going,” said Pilar. “I have seen the
effect; to-morrow I will come back and dress you myself.
I leave you everything complete: shoes, stockings&mdash;look
what pretty ones&mdash;take the blue pair.
Will my shoes fit you? I think so. Here are a pair
of high boots and a pair of shoes.... I have even
brought you gloves, for, if I am not mistaken, you have
none.&mdash;Good-bye till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She kissed her noisily and whispered in her ear:
“To-morrow will be a day of trial for you. I will
order tapers to be lighted before the Holy Picture in
San Prudencio&mdash;but the Lord will uphold you, poor
dear saint and martyr! By the way, my dear, the ceremony
at San Lucas’ to-day had all that aspect&mdash;that
veneer, so to speak&mdash;of vulgar display that sticks to
everything that Antoñita de Rosafría takes in hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
You should have seen the hangings and the flags! It
was like a political demonstration. If they had struck
up Riego’s hymn, I should not have been astonished.
And, oh, my dear, what a sermon! You should hear
that man’s squeaky voice! As for edification!&mdash;Well,
I must not stay any longer; it is growing late. Good-bye.
But one thing strikes me: shall I have tapers
lighted before Our Lady of Sorrows?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said María eagerly, “Our lady of Sorrows.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye Milagros; to-night I have my place at
the opera; I shall be in time for two acts of The Huguenots....
To-morrow then, at noon.”</p>

<p>“At noon, and bring Juana&mdash;I will bring my
dressing-case, for in this house there is not even a powder
puff.”</p>

<p>“Good-night&mdash;good-night.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />

SUING OR DEFIANT?</h2>


<p class="mt3">The marquesa begged her daughter to go to bed,
and María gladly obeyed, for she was very weary.
She slowly divested herself of the handsome garments
which had so unexpectedly resuscitated the beautiful
young woman she had once been, and retired to her alcove.
She was shivering with cold and had sunk into
a fit of deep melancholy. After a long silence, during
which she lay watching her mother with anxious eyes,
she turned her face to the images, pictures, and relics
which made her alcove a sort of oratory, and began to
pray. The marquesa, who could also on great occasions
make a due display of fervour, knelt kissing the
feet of a crucifix.</p>

<p>“Give me my rosary, mamma,” said María; and
the marquesa took her the beads which hung at the
foot of the cross.</p>

<p>“Now you can leave me,” said her daughter. “I
am sleepy, and when I have said my prayers I shall
fall asleep.”</p>

<p>The marquesa fixed the hour at which they were to
set out next day. It was agreed that they should both
go and that the mother should remain in the carriage
while María went in to see her husband.</p>

<p>“My heart tells me that we shall do great things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
perhaps effect a reconciliation,” said the marquesa, kissing
her daughter. “Now go to sleep and do not worry
yourself with matters of conscience. You see the consequences
of your obstinacy; honestly, my dear child,
I put myself in a husband’s place&mdash;any husband’s; it
is not that I wish to blame devotion, true devotion.
Am not I a pious and sincere Catholic, though an unworthy
one? Do I fail in my religious exercise? You
should have thought of this mania for sanctity before
you married and took up other duties.”</p>

<p>“One thing strikes me,” said María showing clearly
that she was not worrying herself about matters of conscience,
“I ought to have some jewelry to-morrow&mdash;a
brooch, bracelets, earrings&mdash;you can bring me anything
you think proper out of the case I gave you to
take care of.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said her mother with some embarrassment.
“But almost all your trinkets wanted mending&mdash;I
sent them to Ansorena. But I will see....”</p>

<p>“Rafaela tells me that you took away all the plate
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Yes, all of it. My dear child, I am always in a
fright at your living alone in this great house. There
are so many robberies.”</p>

<p>“I do not want the plate&mdash;but tell me, did you not
take the silk curtains too, and my lace, and the inlaid
ink-stand and card case&mdash;oh! and those two vases,
and the Sêvres jars, and the fan painted by Zamacois
and the water-colour by Fortuny, and several other
things?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have a remarkably good memory,” said the
marquesa, laughing to conceal her annoyance. “Yes,
I took them away. Such treasures ought not to be left
in danger of robbery. Do you know that Madrid is
swarming with burglars?”</p>

<p>“Then bring me my watch,” said María turning
over in bed, “I had better know the time to a minute.”</p>

<p>“Very well&mdash;but I remember it is gone to be
mended. It did not go.”</p>

<p>“Then I must do without it; goodnight, mamma.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow at ten. I will be here in time to dress
you. Goodnight, my darling.”</p>

<p>But María could not sleep. For the first time in
her life she realised one of her earliest dreams of pious
mortification; she had imagined the possibility of lying
on a bed of brambles, so that her body being tormented
to the great edification of the soul, she might the better
emulate the penitent saints whose lives she had read
with such enthusiasm. That night her bed was a bed
of thorns, till it became a bed of burning coals, and
seemed to scorch her limbs. She felt like St. Laurence
on his gridiron, or St. John in his cauldron; she could
generally get to sleep by repeating her prayers, but to-night
they hung buzzing on her lips, like bees at the
door of a hive, while her brain seemed on fire, writhing
like some soul in the depths of hell, nipped and stung
by Satan’s ministers. She could bear it no longer; in
her ears was a continual hissing like frying; it bewildered
her brain; her very eyes ached in the dark.
She sprang out of bed and struck a light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now,” she said to herself, as she slipped some
clothes on. “Now, this minute!”</p>

<p>Without stopping to put on her shoes and stockings
she went to look at the clock in her boudoir, her heart
sank when she saw that it only marked one. Still so
early! She calculated how long it would be till sunrise;
then she shut herself into her boudoir. Who
can tell what she did there? In the silence of the
night and of empty rooms the clocks, with their regular
ticking, like breathing, seem to live and watch. Perched
on the chimney-shelves, these bronze personages, with
faces like masks with twelve eyes, would make us believe
that they can hear and understand by the same
internal organs which produce that ceaseless and rythmical
beat. The clock in María’s boudoir was the only
witness to her proceedings; the portrait of Leon even
knew nothing about them, for it hung with its face to
the wall. The clock heard her, then, as she opened
and shut various trunks; heard the pleasant splash of
water as it flowed into the marble bath and over the
rounded limbs of a human statue, dancing and rippling
like the waters of a fountain in which alabaster tritons
and nymphs disport themselves among translucent jets,
cascades, and clouds of spray. The impudent rogue of
a clock chuckled to itself as it steadily snapped its hundred
teeth; it was long since it had heard such music.
Then it smelt the faint, sweet savour of perfumes&mdash;it
was long since that scent had been used there.</p>

<p>María returned to the boudoir carrying the light
with her, and her first glance was at the dial near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
which she placed the candle. A quarter past two.
Oh, what a bore is a clock that insists on telling you
that it is very early! She had wrapped herself in an
ample white sheet like a cloak, which helped to produce
a reaction after the cold bath; her face was a
little blue, but none the less charming, and her small
hands clutched the wrapper to gather it round her, as
a dove folds her grey wings over her white breast.
The reaction from cold water is rapid and complete.
She soon felt warm again, and then, as the reversed
portrait caught her eye, she raised her arms to take it
down&mdash;but it was too high. She mounted on a chair
to reach it, and we have it on the authority of the clock
that his mistress in her light attire was a charming
figure which he opened his twelve eyes wide to gaze
at.</p>

<p>María unhooked the portrait and, turning it round,
set it upon a chair. There, as if he were present in the
flesh, were the manly bust, the clever head, the deep
honest eyes of Leon Roch; it was like the sudden entrance
of a living person. María was strangely
startled; all her blood rushed to her heart, leaving her
veins empty and chill; breathless and rigid, she looked
at the picture as though it were the apparition of some
one long dead, or the embodiment of a face in a dream.
It did not frown at her but gazed with a serene and
kind expression&mdash;the natural expression of a warm
and loyal nature. María stooped forward; her face
was close to the portrait&mdash;then she drew back; with
her hand she wiped off a little dust, and having done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
this, she kissed her husband&mdash;once, twice, thrice, on
different parts of his face. At that instant she heard a
dull, smothered chuckle&mdash;it was the clock, taking a
deeper breath with the hoarse effort that is preparatory
to its striking.</p>

<p>Three o’clock! the creature was growing more amiable
and was getting the better of its mania for asserting
that it was early. The house, as has been said,
was on the outskirts of the city, and she could hear the
cocks crowing to proclaim the end of this miserable,
dreary, never-ending night.</p>

<p>“It will soon be day,” thought María. “As soon
as it is day I will set out.”</p>

<p>Then she proceeded to dress. All the things that
Pilar had brought were lying on the chairs, and, but
that there were on the walls three several pictures of
St. Joseph, the room might have been taken for that of
a woman of the world after a night of dissipation.</p>

<p>María examined the colours of the silk stockings
and finally selected the blue pair which she pulled over
the rosy feet. Shoes were a more difficult matter;
she tried the boots and shoes&mdash;happily her friend’s
foot seemed to be the twin brother to her own&mdash;but
she doubted as to the particular pair&mdash;boots or shoes?
A question as important as the greater alternative:
Heaven or Hell?</p>

<p>After much hesitation the boots were definitely discarded
and she decided on the shoes&mdash;high shoes of
bronze kid, Louis XV. shape, and embroidered with
steel&mdash;gems in their way. María looked at them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
a long time and then put them on. She had very
pretty feet&mdash;prettiest of all when bare&mdash;still, she must
have shoes on as a social necessity, though it was not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de
rigeur</i> in the days of Venus; and María looked down
with satisfaction at the artificial beauties of feet with
which not Daphne herself could have run, but which,
nevertheless, were pretty enough to behold. She
placed her foot firmly on the ground, contemplating
the ankle; she turned on her heel and moved the
pointed toe, almost like a thimble; the foot as well as
the face has an expression of its own. María was satisfied
and gave her mind to other matters.</p>

<p>Stays; coiffure; two important matters which could
not be attended to together. The first is sometimes a
question of strength; the second a sublime work of art.
María began with the more serious matter, and it
needed no hydraulic pressure to imprison her slender
waist. The hair-dressing was a greater difficulty. She
seated herself at the dressing-table in a meditative attitude,
with her hands raised like a priest who pauses to
pray before touching some sacred object, and at length,
after various attempts she succeeded in restoring to
some extent the structure that Juana had achieved the
previous evening&mdash;a perfectly simple knot, as it had to
be in the absence of various articles of the toilet. But
it was becoming, and that was the main point. No
puffs or padding.</p>

<p>The rest of her toilet was on the lines of last night’s
rehearsal: the black silk dress, with its linings and trimmings
of straw colour; the hat, which might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the creation of fairy hands.... Nothing could be
better or more bewitching. María gazed at herself in
astonishment; she was a different woman! It could
not be she who was so beautiful. It was magic. Nay,
a good Catholic could not believe in magic! It was a
special mercy of Heaven, a providential interposition,
to enable her to carry out a meritorious purpose. It
could be none other than God who had lent her such
exceptional beauty and such brilliant and becoming attire.
Superstition clung to her soul as a limpet sticks
by suction to a rock.</p>

<p>“God consents, it is God’s will&mdash;” she said to
herself, eagerly seizing on the idea.</p>

<p>Then she looked at herself once more&mdash;in front, in
profile&mdash;yes, she looked well. How slender and well-formed
she was, how gracefully her head was poised on
her shoulders! The misty veil slightly shaded her pale
face, as it might be the shadow of a bird flying by and
pausing to admire so sweet a picture. There was a
sort of symbolical passion in the depths of the black
velvet with lights of straw-coloured silk; in that
sombre nimbus with sulphurous gleams framing her
delicate complexion there was a perfect harmony; and
in those melancholy sea-blue eyes, that looked as if a
threat lurked under their sadness, a revenge under their
pain, under their tenderness a dagger.</p>

<p>“Gloves!” she exclaimed, “where are they? How
provoking if Pilar should have forgotten to leave them.”</p>

<p>She found them however, and put them on.</p>

<p>“I have no trinkets, but that is of no consequence&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
have my virtue,” she added to herself, “that is the
only thing that really matters.”</p>

<p>After another glance in the mirror she went on:
“Yes, I am handsome&mdash;if only I can say just what I
feel.... If I can find the right words....”</p>

<p>She pulled the bell, startling all the household.
The servants were some time getting up, but at last
they appeared. Her maid, who came sleepy and
stupid into her room, was astounded at seeing her mistress
ready dressed&mdash;and so beautifully dressed!
María desired her to send Señor Pomares to her at
once. The worthy man, who had been recalled after
Leon’s departure, presently made his appearance, with
a puffy, stupid face and tottering with the bewildered
air of a man who has been roused from his deepest and
sweetest slumbers. But María did not look at him.</p>

<p>“Order the carriage to be got ready at once,” she
said. The steward looked blank with astonishment.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;you forget,” he said, “you forget...?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That the carriage is gone.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, very true,” said María. “I had forgotten.
Well, send for a hired carriage, a landau.”</p>

<p>“At this hour?”</p>

<p>“Is it not daylight?”</p>

<p>“Dawn is only just breaking.”</p>

<p>“What has that to do with it? It seems to me
that you want to make difficulties ... you are of no
use at all&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Pomares was dumbfounded. So hasty ... so violent....
His mistress must be mad.</p>

<p>“Well, why do you not stir, in Heavens name?”
she exclaimed, “why do you stand staring at me? A
carriage, and at once, at any cost!”</p>

<p>“Very good, Señora; I will go and see.”</p>

<p>“At once; as quickly as possible. I want to be off
as soon as it is light.”</p>

<p>After infinite trouble Pomares, dragging his weary
limbs from one place to another, succeeded in hiring a
carriage; but not till the day was somewhat far advanced.
María burning with impatience, waited in
her room. She took a cup of black coffee, and then
alternately paced the room and paused to pray, or sat
sunk in thought.</p>

<p>When at length the landau was announced she
started up, and going straight to a pretty little cupboard
she took out a bottle of not remarkably pure
water. Her lips moved, muttering no doubt a prayer,
while she poured part of the contents into a silver cup;
then, carefully lifting her veil she drank that water
which was from the sacred Grotto at Lourdes.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_V">CHAPTER V.<br />

THE ICE GIVES WAY.</h2>


<p class="mt3">María had not gone more than half a mile when a
terrible reflection occurred to her&mdash;a thought at once
so serious and so obvious that she was on the point of
turning back. It struck her that her dress, having been
chosen with a view to an afternoon drive, was unsuitable
for so early a visit&mdash;nay, ridiculous not to say
“loud.” How could she have overlooked this when
she was dressing? Why had she not chosen other and
simpler things, more suitable according to all the
accepted laws of society for morning wear? She was
really upset and distressed; however, there was now no
remedy; so, though she was vexed to think that on such
an occasion she should not be a model of good taste, she
consoled herself with the reflection that beauty lays
down the laws of fashion and has never been its slave.
Other and more important matters soon put all thoughts
of dress out of her head. As she drove along she tried
to compose and remember appropriate phrases and
speeches. She knew exactly what her husband would
say, and how she, as the outraged wife, ought to reply.
Sentence after sentence surged up in her brain as
readily as if it were the crucible of the Spanish Academy.
Now and then an adjective seemed too weak and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
substituted a stronger one; here and there a statement
of fact gave way to a hypothesis; and thus anticipating
the utterance of her wrath and injuries, she grew so
excited that she spoke aloud to herself.</p>

<p>She paid no heed to the road along which she was
being carried, nor to any object she passed. At the
same time, as frequently happens when the mind is full
of a fixed group of ideas, María, while she took no
conscious note of the more important details, involuntarily
absorbed certain trivial and minute ones. She
observed a dead bird lying by the road, and a tavern
sign-board in which the letter A was missing; as she
passed the tram-car she perceived that the driver was
blind of one eye. This is one of the commonest and
oddest of mental phenomena.</p>

<p>At length she reached the hamlet, or rather detached
suburb&mdash;neither town nor country, but an irregular
medley of mansions and dung-hills. Not knowing precisely
which way to go, she enquired of some women
who civilly directed her; the man drove on. Now she
was near the house&mdash;it must be quite close. Her heart
throbbed wildly, and all the speeches she had so laboriously
prepared deserted her at once.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped ... she could hardly stand.
She saw a gate leading into a large court-yard, full of
furniture cases, and an iron bed packed for moving.
There was a woman too, talking to some one she could
not see. María went in and approached her; then, to
her horror, she saw that she was talking to herself; was
she mad? But María asked for Don Leon Roch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don Leon Roch?” said Facunda with a good-humoured
smile after a pause of astonishment. “He
is up there.” And she pointed to a door through
which a staircase was visible.</p>

<p>María hurried up, but about half way she was forced
to stop for breath. At the top she went into a large
light room; there was no one there.</p>

<p>She saw books, articles of furniture that she recognised,
all in confusion as packed for removal, but no
one ... no one.</p>

<p>Suddenly, like a bird that hops out of a hedge at
the sound of a voice, a little girl appeared from behind
a table. She held a broken doll and was eating a piece
of bread. She was warmly wrapped up, and on her
head she wore a little white hood, very much like a
nun’s. Her face was that of a cherub, if a cherub can
be supposed to have a little wet nose from a cold sharp
morning. Monina fixed her eyes on the dazzling vision
that had suddenly appeared in the doorway and stared
at it speechless and motionless. This was not a lady;
it was a doll, a very large doll dressed like a lady, and
the child’s astonishment soon changed to alarm. She
saw the figure come slowly towards her without taking
her eyes off her ... and such eyes! Monina turned
white and would have cried out but she was too frightened.
This enormous doll came slowly up to her without
seeming to walk, and when it had reached her it
stooped down ... the poor little thing was too much
terrified to scream; those eyes had turned her to stone.
It put out a hand and laid it on Monina’s shoulder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Then, clutching the little arm, it squeezed it tighter&mdash;tighter&mdash;like
an iron vice, while in a voice which
Monina did not recognise as human, but rather as the
strange croak which dwells in a doll’s body and utters
“papa” and “mamma,” it asked her:</p>

<p>“Who are you? What is your name?”</p>

<p>The instinct of self preservation conquered her terrors,
and at last poor Ramona found her voice. She
gave a shrill cry and pulled away her arm. Leon Roch
came to the door of the adjoining room where he too
stood still, like a statue in a niche. Unlike St. Thomas,
he saw but he could not believe. For a minute or two
he could not shake off his dismay and astonishment, seeing
clearly the dilemma in which he was placed. Her
appearance there was extraordinary no doubt, but anything
rather than absurd; what was absurd, was her
coming fashionably bedizened with such extravagant
elegance at this hour of the morning. It was a phenomenon
which had formed no factor in his calculations
and which was, so far, perfectly inexplicable. Having
presently mastered his feelings and determined to face
the scene that was evidently inevitable, Leon, before
saying a word to his wife, took Monina’s hand, went to
the top of the stairs and called some one to whom he
entrusted the child; then, turning back into the room,
he shut the door resolutely, like a lion-tamer who locks
himself in with the savage favourites, who, to him, are,
after all, only part of his family.</p>

<p>María had seated herself; in fact she could hardly
stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>“You did not expect me?” she said tremulously.</p>

<p>“No, I certainly did not.”</p>

<p>“You thought you were free! poor man ... free to
pursue ... without a road ... free, I mean, to pursue
the road of infamy without let or hindrance. No, no!
you must account to ... to me....”</p>

<p>All the speeches that María had in fancy delivered
with so much unction had evaporated, word by word.
She made a desperate effort to remember a single effective
phrase; in vain! they were gone. She could hardly
catch at a word as they whirled through her brain, and
she could only cry out in a husky voice:</p>

<p>“Guilty wretch!”</p>

<p>Leon smiled slightly and María went on: “Wretch!
I am here to apprehend you.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Leon calmly accepting the idea.
“But allowing that I am guilty, and a wretch, and that
you are the police&mdash;you have no chain to fetter me
with because you yourself have broken it.”</p>

<p>María had prepared her rejoinders on the supposition
that her husband would answer her as she had
imagined; but as Leon said something quite different
she was in the position of an actor who has lost his
cues.</p>

<p>“The chain,” she murmured, not at the instant understanding
what he meant, “and I, you say, have
broken it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you. Who but you gave me my liberty?”</p>

<p>“You are a wretch, a libertine, a villain!” cried
María dropping into the vulgar recrimination of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
angry wife. “Liberty? What do you mean by it?
You have none. You are my husband&mdash;tied to me by
a bond that none but God can sever, since it was He
who bound us. You abominable materialists think that
the ordinance of matrimony is a thing to be played fast
and loose with. I tell you it is a divine institution.”</p>

<p>“And a human institution as well. But we need
not bandy words María. Tell me what did you come
here for?”</p>

<p>“And now he dares to ask me what I came for!”
she exclaimed, her nervousness giving way to a frenzy
of wrath. “I will tell you. I came to require of you
an account of your criminal behaviour, to surprise you
in your lair, to put you to open shame, and then&mdash;and
then to scorn you.”</p>

<p>“But you could have scorned me without coming
here.”</p>

<p>“I wished to see whether you had a remnant of
shame and decency; whether I could surprise you, face
to face; if you would dare to confess your sin....”</p>

<p>“You have, you see, surprised me somewhat,” said
Leon raising his eyes. “As regards my sins, if I have
committed any, it is not to you that I owe a confession.”</p>

<p>“What audacious impudence!... But I came for
something more,” added María livid with rage. “I
came in the hope of finding here that abandoned
woman, and of giving her the name she deserves;
to ...” She clenched her fists and her eyes glared.</p>

<p>“What woman?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>“The hypocrite can ask! I do not name her for it
would stain my lips ... do you dare to tell me that you
are not on terms of disgraceful&mdash;of criminal intimacy
with her?”</p>

<p>“With whom?”</p>

<p>“With her....” And she pointed in the direction of
Suertebella.</p>

<p>“María” said Leon gravely and turning pale, “I
do not like to see you a propagator of base slander. I
should find it very difficult to cease to respect you; but
if you wish that I should never fail in the consideration
which I owe to you, never repeat that question. Be
silent ... go ... leave me. You do not want my love
since your religion is all in all to you; go, serve your
altars, and leave me alone with my conscience.”</p>

<p>María drew herself up, clenching her arms against
her breast like a wild beast preparing to spring; her
eyes for a moment seemed dimmed, but the next instant
they flashed fire.</p>

<p>“Coward, villain!” she exclaimed. “Do you dare
to tear yourself away from me, your lawful wife, the
wife to whom you belong and whom you shall never
escape!... No, never&mdash;since God has pronounced us
one? Who are you, a miserable wretch, to desecrate a
sacrament and disobey the Father of us all?”</p>

<p>“Desecrate a sacrament? I ... I?” Leon stood
up and went close to his wife. “It is not I,” he said,
“who desecrate the sacrament.”</p>

<p>“Who then?”</p>

<p>“You,” he said, pointing with his finger so close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
her face that it was as if he meant to put out her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“You.&mdash;You cast it to the winds. When I was
trying to save our home and peace you said to me:
‘My God requires me to say that I do not love you.’”</p>

<p>For a second María was abashed and silent; her
wrath had abated a little.</p>

<p>“It is true that I said that. And, after all, if you
desire my love, why do you not try to merit it by becoming
a Christian and a Catholic. In spite of your
wicked atheism I cannot say that I do not love you ...
a little. But oh! why are you not like me? Why do
you not imitate my piety?”</p>

<p>“Because it is beyond me,” he retorted sarcastically,
“because there are forms of piety so unnatural, so insane,
so absurd, silly and irrational.... But at least you
must admit that it was you, you yourself who desecrated
the sacrament.”</p>

<p>“But I,” replied his wife, catching at a cogent argument.
“I have been faithful and you have not.”</p>

<p>Leon was staggered for an instant.</p>

<p>“I have been faithful too,” he said. “I swear it
before God and by the sacred memory of my father
and mother! Faithful, tender and kind to the last
extremity&mdash;even when you, carried away by a sickly piety,
and by the example and ardent warnings of your hapless
brother, built up a wall of ice between your soul
and mine. You refused to bestow on me even the commonplaces
of affection, the gentle words and tones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
which may take the place of love when love is dead;
you humiliated me with your senseless scruples and
cruel recriminations, that bore a hideous resemblance to
vulgar abuse; you made my home empty and dark,
casting a gloom over it that oppressed my heart, dried
my brain, and embittered my blood; you took a delight
in neglecting your person to the extent even of sluttishness;
to annoy me more deeply you dressed in absurd
and shapeless clothes, and took a pride in making yourself
repulsive and odious. Every word I spoke you regarded
as blasphemy, and all my thoughts and feelings
were crimes worthy to be punished by the inquisition.
You were mad and blind! If you felt called to such a
career of sanctity why did you not try to imitate the
patience&mdash;a saintly patience, surely&mdash;with which I
endured your proud assumption of humility, your unchristian
bitterness, and your devotion, which for insolence,
vexatiousness and recalcitrancy was for all the
world like the pranks of a troup of demons playing the
part of angels with masks on.</p>

<p>“And you come to me&mdash;to me who have borne all
this&mdash;to me whom you have hated and tormented&mdash;to
me! and call me to account instead of asking my
forgiveness. ‘Pardon,’ María is the only word that it
becomes you to utter this day! after all your bigotry,
and hypocrisy, and insults, you desire me to account to
you ... for what? A woman who has told her husband
that she does not love him cannot call him to account.
I have been more than considerate in not declaring our
marriage as void, in still acknowledging you as my wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
in regarding myself as still bound to you by some invisible
tie, in asking not for liberty but only for peace&mdash;not
for compensation but only for respite!”</p>

<p>“You might indeed lodge some complaint against
me,” retorted María, “if, since that time, you had been
as faithful to me as I have been to you. But you have
not; nay you have long, long been false to me.”</p>

<p>“It is not true.”</p>

<p>“Yes, false and faithless,” she insisted, clinging to
the statement with feverish vehemence. “And instead
of defending yourself you turn upon me! Those are the
tactics of every clever criminal.... I was blind, ignorant
of your perfidy. You have cheated me shamefully!”</p>

<p>“It is not true.”</p>

<p>“For a long time, for years.”</p>

<p>“Not true.”</p>

<p>“But at last it has all come to my knowledge. I
have discovered the whole truth. You cannot deny it,
for the present throws light on the past and your crime
of to-day betrays that of yesterday. You have lost all
decency; you do not even hide the distant date of
your intimacy&mdash;and here, in this house, where you
have buried yourself to revel in your sin, you pass
whole days playing with that child ... with that sniffling
little brat!...”</p>

<p>Leon glared at his wife with a terrible expression;
his eyes darted arrows of wrath. María drew a deep
breath and added in a hoarse voice: “With her child&mdash;which
is yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>With livid lips and a murderous glare in his eyes,
looking as an assassin may in the very act, Leon went
up to his wife and seizing her by the arm he shook her
in his fury:</p>

<p>“It is a calumny,” he said, “a lie....”</p>

<p>Then he let her go, swallowing down the rest of the
words that were on his tongue.</p>

<p>María stung and devoured by all the serpents of
jealousy, had no words for the rage that burned within
her; for when jealousy has reached a certain pitch it
cannot find utterance&mdash;it must act. Her revenge could
not be satisfied with anything less than the destruction
of the innocent cause of her indignation. To tear
Monina limb from limb was what her passion prompted
her to do, and without a moment’s hesitation she acted
on the impulse; she snatched up the doll that Monina
had left on a chair and tore it to pieces&mdash;arms, legs,
hair&mdash;the trembling hands of the outraged wife
wreaked her vengeance on the senseless toy. Then,
flinging the fragments away, she exclaimed in broken
gasps:</p>

<p>“There ... that ... that is how your lawful wife
ought to treat her ... her....” She was almost choking.</p>

<p>Leon, recovering his self-command, spoke again.</p>

<p>“I should have thought you incapable of becoming
the mouthpiece of such an infamous slander. Of what
use is piety if it leaves you in ignorance of the first
elements of charity? You never can have had any
feelings!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh yes, I had once,” said María exhausted by her
own rage. “But I can thank God that I have not
transmitted them to any child of yours. He has
blessed me in making me childless, as He has blessed
other women in giving them children. He could not
grant a family to an atheist!”</p>

<p>“Your blasphemy appals me,” said Leon, who could
endure no more. “Can a sacrament be more utterly
annulled, or a bond more effectually cut? Between
you and me, María, there is a great gulf&mdash;bottomless
and infinite; a space of endless desert in which, try as
I may, I cannot see a single idea or feeling that we can
have in common. Let us part forever; do not try to
bring together two distinct worlds which cannot approach
each other without tempest and lightnings. If
there ever were two irreconcilable beings, we are they.
For I too am a fanatic; you have taught me to be, like
you, a bigot&mdash;an ardent, even a relentless bigot. We
will part, each to his own shore, and let the waste that
lies between us be as the ocean of oblivion. Nay, to
soothe our consciences, I will say the ocean of forgiveness.
Each may forgive; both may forget ... good-bye.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking María’s feelings of anger and
revenge had given way to other and very different sentiments,
calmer and more contemplative, which by degrees
took absolute possession of her agitated mind.
She looked at her husband and found him&mdash;why should
she deny it?&mdash;worthier than ever to be the friend and
companion of a loving wife. His face had a charm of
its own, with the dark beard that gave it an indefinable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
expression of romantic melancholy, with the eager eyes
and broad brow, on which a reflected gleam of sunshine
at that moment fell, like a beam of glory on that wise
and intelligent head. This mute contemplation of his
manly good looks appealed directly to her heart and
made it beat with excitement. Her first and only love
revived; she remembered the happiness of the early
days of their marriage and against the background of
these memories the fact stood out that the man was interesting,
attractive, and&mdash;why not confess it?&mdash;very
good-looking; she could not take her eyes off his face.
‘But not for her&mdash;for another woman!’ This was the
spark that fired the whole edifice, that scathed and rent
her soul, so that all her piety leaked out, so to speak.
This was the diabolical idea that turned her ice to fire,
her scorn to a tenderer passion and all that was harsh
in her nature to gentleness&mdash;that lent grace and elegance
even to her absurd dress. She was desperately in
love, in short, from jealousy rather than from sympathy.
It was a fearful blow to her to hear herself calmly dismissed&mdash;with
a friendly pardon, it is true&mdash;but still
definitely dismissed. She could have borne to accept
her dismissal and part from him for ever; she might
even forget him, and forgive him for having ceased to
love her ... but that he should love another....</p>

<p>“No, never, never!” she exclaimed, as the result of
her reflections; and her eyes sparkled through tears.
But she would not confess the weakness, and hastily
drying her eyes she went on:</p>

<p>“One night you asked me....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I asked you....”</p>

<p>“And I told you that God forbid my love for you ...
and it is true; God did forbid it. I felt it in my soul,
but yet ... you see, you should not have taken the answer.
You should have asked once more.”</p>

<p>“But I had asked you so often, and in so many different
ways.”</p>

<p>“Well, now I ask you,” and she went up to him and
laid her hands on his shoulders; “I ask you: ‘Do you
still love me?’” Leon’s nature rebelled against a lie.
He paused to question his conscience. For an instant
he thought that a generous falsehood would be the
nobler course; but then he revolted against the notion
of a mock devotion. Almost before he had thought out
the matter the truth broke from his lips.</p>

<p>“No.... My God ... mine, María, compels me to
say No.”</p>

<p>She dropped back into her seat. It was with a sort
of roar that she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Your God is a fiend!”</p>

<p>“You have no claim to anything more than my respect.”</p>

<p>“You love some one else?” she went on, gnawing
the corner of her handkerchief, “tell me the truth.... I
know you are truthful ... confess it and I will leave
you in peace for ever.”</p>

<p>“But I deny your right to ask,” said Leon after a
moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“Deny my right if you will; but reply.”</p>

<p>Leon was on the point of saying: “Well then I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
do.” But there are cases in which the truth is a form
of murder; when it is baser than a lie.</p>

<p>“Well then,” he said, “no.”</p>

<p>“Your face betrays you, it is false!” said María
starting up.</p>

<p>“My face?”</p>

<p>“You never used to tell lies.... I know that you
never told lies. But this minute you prove to me that
you have lost even that grace!”</p>

<p>Leon made no reply, and María, after a short pause,
went on:</p>

<p>“I have no further business here....” Still he said
nothing; he did not even look at her. “None, none,” she
said. “I blush to think that I should ever have crossed
the threshold of this abode of scandal and wickedness.”</p>

<p>She moistened her parched lips with her tongue, but
there was a bitter dryness on both, compared to which
aloes are as honey for sweetness. Her impulse was to
spit out something ... to spit out that other She whose
name was as the savour of fruits plucked in the court of
hell. She stammered some inarticulate words and bit
her lips till the blood came.</p>

<p>“It is a shame ... a disgrace!” she muttered. “To
have fallen to such depths ... to have flung myself at
the feet of this wretch ... a woman like me ... a
woman!...” She was too angry to shed tears&mdash;even
tears of rage. “Scorned ... despised....”</p>

<p>“Despised, no,” said her husband, moving towards
her with an impulse of generosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Despised as if I were a....”</p>

<p>“Never despised....”</p>

<p>“Not even....”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Not worthy of your consideration.”</p>

<p>“Consideration, certainly ...” said Leon who was
as much disturbed as she was; but she was going
through a phase of reaction into the depths of dejection.</p>

<p>“To you,” she went on, “I am not even good to
look at. You hate the sight of me; I have lost....”</p>

<p>“No,” said Leon “I swear to you that, since I first
met you, I have never seen you so beautiful as you are
to-day.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” she cried writhing in her chair, “and
yet you do not love me....”</p>

<p>“You,” retorted Leon “you who have so much
cultivated the spiritual life must surely know that beauty
of face and person is not what can best captivate the
soul!”</p>

<p>“And to you my nature is hideous?” And she
struck her forehead with a wild groan, as though she
had suddenly remembered some vital fact or had come
to her right mind after an interval of mental delusion.
“How should it be otherwise when I am a Christian
and you a reprobate atheist? Of course, of course ...
and I have been so mad&mdash;mad do I say?&mdash;So wicked,
as to take my eyes for a moment away from my Lord
and Saviour to gaze on you&mdash;an infidel. I have put
off my black serge to dress myself in this frippery, fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
only for a lost woman, with the base purpose of pleasing&mdash;of
courting you. My God! canst Thou ever forgive
me?”</p>

<p>She snatched off her hat in delirious rage, and tearing
it to fragments strewed them about the floor. In
her haste she pulled down her hair which she had not
fastened securely; the black locks fell about her temples
and over her shoulders. She looked like a mad
creature as she went close up to her husband and said
to him in a low voice:</p>

<p>“I am as bad as you. I am an unworthy wretch.
I forgot my God, my duty, and my dignity for your
sake.... Wretch! I do not deserve to be called a
saint, for a saint....” She glanced at her handsome
dress with horror. “Women who devote themselves
truly to God would not have put on this livery of sin.
I am ashamed to see myself so tricked out. Away with
you, for filthy rags!”</p>

<p>She tore the trimmings with unnatural strength,
rending the stuff and ripping off the buttons, and at
length she threw off her cloak and gloves and flung
them into a corner.</p>

<p>“Enough, enough; I have stooped too low. I
will return to God&mdash;to my seclusion and indifference
to this world. I will curse my beauty for having
pleased you. I will return to the peaceful practice of
religion. No worldly humiliations can touch me then;
I will find rest in sacred meditations, conversing with
God and seeing the angels, and hearing the music of
their songs in Heaven; I will go back to my peaceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
life where, at any rate, I may be so happy as to forget
you! In its gloom you will not come to curse my
sight.... I have sinned and am unworthy of the least
of the Lord’s mercies. Forgive, O Lord! Forgive!
Never again will I sin thus.”</p>

<p>She fell on her knees and melted into tears that
flowed in a ready torrent, while she covered her face
with her trembling hands. They trickled through her
fingers, and down on to her bosom, where she had torn
her dress open. Leon was alarmed; the pathetic,
helpless attitude and bitter fit of weeping touched him
deeply. He bent over her and raising her in his arms
placed her in a seat.</p>

<p>“María for God’s sake do not go mad,” he said.
“Compose yourself&mdash;control yourself.” But she kept
her hands clasped over her face.</p>

<p>Leon laid his hand on her shoulder, tried to rearrange
her disordered hair and pull her dress round her&mdash;for
she had really half-undressed herself in her fury.
Suddenly she threw her arm round his neck with a convulsive
energy and he felt her burning lips close to his
cheek, but she did not kiss him; in a husky faint voice
she said:</p>

<p>“I will strangle you&mdash;I will murder you if you love
any one else.&mdash;Am I not handsomer, am I not more
beautiful than she is?... Mine! you are mine....
Mine only....” But her grasp relaxed and her arms
fell helplessly by her side; her head drooped on her
breast, her hair veiling her face; a spasmodic quiver
passed over her throat and neck&mdash;a shiver of the skin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
he heard a faint murmur from her lips: “Dying&mdash;sinful....”
And she sat in a heap speechless and unconscious.
He felt her heart&mdash;her pulse; there was no
perceptible flutter.</p>

<p>He rushed to the stairs, shouting for help. No
sooner had he opened the door than the room was full
of people. Curiosity had brought the neighbours together,
for they had heard loud voices; the cries they
knew were uttered by the wife of Señor Leon Roch,
and a wife who cries out is a legitimate object of sympathy
and curiosity. They rushed up into the room,
and with them the Marquis de Fúcar, who had come
to give Leon his little commission for Paris. But they
all stood in helpless astonishment.</p>

<p>“Take her to my house at once,” said Fúcar.
“Have you any brandy, any spirit? The first thing is
to put her to bed, to send for a doctor.... Take her
to my house.”</p>

<p>“No, the doctor can come here,” said Leon.</p>

<p>“But you have no bed,” said Fúcar looking round
at the dismantled room.</p>

<p>“There is my bed,” said Facunda. “A king has
not got a better.”</p>

<p>“Move away all of you&mdash;let me see. I think her
heart is still beating.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, it is certainly beating,” exclaimed Leon
hopefully.</p>

<p>“It will be nothing&mdash;merely a fainting fit&mdash;and
all for a squabble! You see the consequences of exageration....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
But we must get her to bed. Wrap her
in a cloak&mdash;get me a cloak.”</p>

<p>The Marquis de Fúcar was an invaluable person in
these emergencies, when prompt decision, energy, and
a tone of command are indispensable. Four strong
arms lifted María, wrapped her carefully in a cloak, and
carried her down stairs. It was like carrying a body to
be buried. Leon looked on and allowed them to act,
as he would have looked on at any other step Fúcar
might have taken. It was like a scene in a dream, and
for some time he failed to remember that this arrangement,
which from one point of view was the best thing
that could be done, from another was the very reverse;
but by that time the little procession had started.</p>

<p>Pepa’s astonishment on seeing this inanimate figure
brought into her house can easily be imagined....
“Merciful Heaven! María Sudre!” and what a state
she was in. She could understand the fainting fit, but
it was not so easy to account for the torn dress and
dishevelled hair.</p>

<p>They carried her into the first bed-room they came
to and laid her on the bed.</p>

<p>“You have forgotten the most important thing of
all,” said Pepa. “To undo her stays.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. How stupid of us!”</p>

<p>And, as he spoke, Don Pedro cut the laces with his
pocket-knife. The village doctor now came in; he
spoke of congestion of the brain, and regarded the case
as serious. A messenger was at once despatched to
bring the most celebrated consulting physician of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Madrid. Presently, however, an improvement was
evident; María turned over, opened her eyes, and
breathed more easily. If it were but a fainting fit after
all.</p>

<p>But María as she recovered her faculties was evidently
delirious; she took no heed of where she was or
of those who stood by her side, not recognising her husband.
After talking feebly but wildly for a few minutes
she fell asleep; silence, perfect silence, was indispensable.
The doctor gave some instructions and prescriptions.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “leave her in silence and darkness.
There is at any rate no immediate danger; but
you must not allow the slightest sound in this room or
in those adjoining; and she is better alone than with
more than one person in the room.” He went away.</p>

<p>Pepa with her finger to her lips enjoined silence.
Leon and the Marquis Fúcar stood speechless, gazing
at the patient. At the end of half an hour Pepa said:</p>

<p>“She is sound asleep and seems to be comfortable.
When she wakes I will come and sit with her; I will
see that she has everything she needs.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” Leon interposed eagerly. “I beg&mdash;I
entreat you not to come into the room at all.” Pepa
bowed her head and she and her father went away on
tiptoe.</p>

<p>Leon sat down by the bed. He was still under the
influence of the horror and alarm of the first shock, and
even now had no clear idea of the position in which he
and his wife stood to each other. María lay still, sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
as if she were quite tired out; the hapless husband
looked vaguely round the room. He sighed. There
was something eerie in the air. Presently Pepa returned
through a door concealed by some hangings;
Leon looked up, startled and vexed; but she came
nearer evidently puzzled and inquisitive. She was
paler even than María&mdash;as pale as death. Her footfall
was inaudible on the thick carpet and she might
have been a ghost. She took no notice of Leon’s anxious
gesture of warning but came close to the bed, and
looked down fixedly at the sleeping woman as if she
were studying the most interesting, but at the same
time the most appalling, object in the universe. At her
heels crept Monina, as softly as a kitten that steals in
and out, and clutching at her mother’s skirts in visible
alarm, she pointed to the bed and whispered: “Big
dolly dead.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />

RETURN TO CONSCIOUSNESS.</h2>


<p class="mt3">Leon Roch sat alone, but not at peace, by the
bed where his wife lay sleeping. Watching her face, to
note in its varying expression anything that might be
a symptom of danger or a sign of improvement, his attention
wandered occasionally from the patient to himself
and the painful position in which he was placed by
events and persons. How was it that he had fallen
into it. How was it that he had not been able
to foresee and prevent this diabolical crossing of the
two circles in which he moved&mdash;the two orbits of
antagonistic ideas and feelings? And as he asked himself
the answer came with a mocking laugh from the
depths of his consciousness, in the words of his own
theories at the time of his engagement and marriage.
In the early days of this veracious history he had, as
we know, dreamed magnificent dreams, and among
others that of moulding his life by making himself its
master and ruling it absolutely to his will. But the
men who cherish this dream of triumph take no account
of what we may call Social Destiny&mdash;an irresistible
power composed of creeds&mdash;our own and others; of
personal or collective resistance; of the errors&mdash;nay of
the virtues&mdash;of our neighbours; of a thousand trifles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
which, from time to time, must be defied or deferred to;
and finally of law and custom which it is rarely permissible,
or even possible, to fight single-handed.</p>

<p>Leon was sorry for himself; at the same time he
could not help laughing himself to scorn. “It is really
absurd,” he said to himself, “that a stone cannot move
without rolling down hill.”</p>

<p>As he thought of all this and much more, he did
not cease to watch the progress of his patient. Two or
three times in the course of the day María roused from
her torpid state, but her mind was clouded; she knew
no one and talked wildly. Conscious of suffering and
unable to determine or localize it she tried to fling herself
out of bed, and Leon had to use some force to prevent
her. Towards night she became quieter but the
fever did not diminish. The doctor, however, found
that her pulse was steadier. In her sleep she spoke
more clearly and coherently, but at last, clasping her
hands on her bosom she cried aloud: “No, no, never!
He is mine&mdash;mine!” With this she woke to clear consciousness;
her eyes wandered round the room examining
the walls, the ceiling, the bed&mdash;she perceived that
she was in a strange place. Her calm gaze showed
that her mind was collected though somewhat weary
and that she had recovered her powers of judgment.
Seeing her husband sitting by the bed, alone, watchful,
and anxious, her eyes softened and she smiled as she
said: “You?”</p>

<p>Leon went close to her and bent down putting his
hand under the coverlet to feel her pulse; she clutched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
at his wrist and clasped it to her breast saying with a
tremulous sob:</p>

<p>“What a mercy, to know that it was only a dream.
I saw you&mdash;it was dark, and they were going to put
you into a fiery furnace. I was terrified to death&mdash;I
screamed out....”</p>

<p>Her imagination, excited by emotion and rage had
been entangled in a vortex of horrible visions&mdash;a
frenzying whirl of shapes and colours ending without
colour or shape, and then had gone through an agony
of terror&mdash;lost in a void of space and blackness, filled
only by the very presence of Fear. As she reached the
bottom of the abyss, rushing downwards with increasing
impetus, she was suddenly dazzled with light. This was
Hell. She saw it of course with its hideous inhabitants
as she had imagined them in her waking hours from
written descriptions and pictures; but as our conceptions
of the supernatural are always modified by the ideas of
the time, and wear the aspect of familiar scenes and objects&mdash;so
that, as we know, our notion even of the Almighty
varies with the age&mdash;María saw the infernal
precincts as vast railway tunnels or gasometers reeking
with smoke and stench, or as a murky foundry with its
roaring forges and machines clashing and shrieking,
with the groaning of bellows, the thud of hammers, and
the glare and swelter of a furnace. The demons, while
retaining their traditional guise of deformed men with
hoofs and tails, seemed to toil like smiths and scavengers,
like the myrmidons of a gas-factory or of a coal-mine,
the Cyclops of Birmingham or Sheffield. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
were grimy, and bathed in sweat, and shiny as with the
exuded grease of machinery. It was a gulf formed by
the meeting of tunnels, and galleries, and iron causeways;
the atmosphere was a mixture of coal dust, sulphur,
gas and petroleum&mdash;the odour was most abhorrent
to our heroine. In the midst of it all there was a
tumult, a noise, a turmoil of which she could have given
no conception but by saying that a thousand trains
rushed at express speed on a central point and met&mdash;but
no sooner was the catastrophe accomplished than it
at once began again. Locomotives were in fact the
principal feature in the Inferno of her delirious dream;
she saw them tearing past, flying with wings tipped
with claws of iron, snorting, groaning, rolling fiery eyes,
and breathing out smoke and sparks and steam. Though
they were as large&mdash;as she thought&mdash;as in real life, in
that infinite void they were as a cloud of flies buzzing
stupendously.</p>

<p>Soon after their marriage Leon and María had made
a tour in Germany where, among other things, they had
seen Krupp’s great foundry works at Essen. The scene
had made a deep impression on María that had never
quite been effaced, and in this torment of hallucination
the images brought away from that immense laboratory
played a leading part in the composition of the picture
of the eternal limbo whither men are consigned for their
sins. Smaller foundries of the same kind, at Barcelona
and in France, had supplied various details and gave
movement to the terrific scene. The damned were spun
round in a lathe and rounded off like cannons or passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
between rollers, coming out as flat as paper; then they
were cast into the white heat of the furnace and recovered
their natural form. Some were put into chains and
their heads laid on an anvil under a gigantic hammer
that crushed their skulls. The inferior demons&mdash;the
rabble rout of Hell, amused themselves by drilling holes
in the skulls of some of their victims, and inserting a
spoonful of fused metal&mdash;the extract of a heap of
books which were seething in a bulky black cauldron,
a hell-broth of heretical ideas. Others, whose crime was
evil-speaking of sacred things, had their tongues torn
out by particularly hideous fiends, and these tongues,
hundreds and thousands of them, were twisted together
to form a rope which was then hung to the vault, looking
like strings of sausages put there to dry. Others
again were put through a strange torment, almost impossible
to describe. The wretches were knotted together,
legs with arms, and arms with heads, into a
string or chain&mdash;a tissue of suffering and wailing. This
chain was then dragged out by a huge screw, till its
length was stretched from miles to leagues, while the
bones cracked with a noise like that of nuts trampled
on by a thousand horses, and the flesh was racked and
torn; and these again, being flung into the furnace, recovered
their original shape to go once more through
the same torture.</p>

<p>María saw all this in an anguish of terror: She was
there, and she was not; she could not shriek, she could
not even breathe. But at length there came a moment
when terror gave way to grief. Among the crowd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
damned&mdash;guilty of unpardonable sin&mdash;was one who
seemed to be especially heinous, judging from the crowd
of demons, male and female, who surrounded him.
This was Leon. María saw him seized, clutched by the
horrible greasy hands, cast into the boiling cauldron,
dragged out with a skimmer, pushed back with a spoon.
Finally they picked him up on a pitchfork and carried him
to the mouth of a furnace so fiery that any earthly fire
would seem as ice by comparison. Then it was that
María uttered a cry, threw up her arm and hand&mdash;her
arm that seemed of enormous length, her hand that
smarted with the burning heat:</p>

<p>“No, no, never&mdash;he is mine!”</p>

<p>The dream was broken, it vanished like the page of
a book that is suddenly closed&mdash;but the impression remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAP_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />

WILL SHE DIE.</h2>


<p class="mt3">María awoke to find herself in a large, bare room.
Her husband stood in front of her, alive and tangible.
She did not recognize the place, but she felt that she
was in safe hands.</p>

<p>“Whose house is this?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Mine.... Be calm. I am here.&mdash;Do you not see
me?”</p>

<p>María’s eyes wandered round the walls, and up to
the ceiling.</p>

<p>“What a dismal place!” she murmured. “And I&mdash;did
I come here?”</p>

<p>Then she was silent, trying to collect her confused
memories.</p>

<p>The morning after the event which might well be
called a catastrophe, Leon had discussed with the Marquis
de Fúcar and Moreno Rubio the best means of
moving María back to Madrid. Don Pedro thought
the scheme dangerous, and the physician had firmly
opposed it, saying that, in the state in which she was,
the journey, no matter how carefully managed, might
result in a rapid and fatal collapse. Leon was excessively
annoyed and disappointed; nay, would certainly have
carried out his purpose, if the doctor had not threatened
to withdraw, and give up all further responsibility. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
it was impossible to remove her from Suertebella, though
it was the last spot on earth where she ought, or could
wish to be, he thought that the best plan would be to
dismantle the room; and by the permission of his generous
host he removed all the pictures, ornaments, porcelain
and bric-a-brac. The room itself was very
unpretending and was only hung with a common paper,
so that it now looked bare enough.</p>

<p>“Yes, you came here,” replied her husband, stroking
her hair. “You have been ill; but you are better
now; it will be nothing serious.”</p>

<p>“Ah yes!” said María, struck with a sudden pang
of remembrance. “It was my jealousy, your infidelity
that brought me here.&mdash;But is this the house?”</p>

<p>“This is my bedroom.”</p>

<p>“Those walls&mdash;that high ceiling.&mdash;Why did you
not take me home at once?”</p>

<p>“We will go when you have rested a little.”</p>

<p>“What has been the matter?”</p>

<p>“A little over-fatigue; it will lead to nothing serious.”</p>

<p>“I remember&mdash;you behaved disgracefully to me.
What did I say to you? Did I say I forgave you? Or
did I only dream it?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;you forgave me,” said Leon to soothe her.</p>

<p>“You promised you would love no one but me.
You swore that you loved me, and to make me believe
it you gave me proofs.... Is it so or did I dream it?”</p>

<p>“It is quite true.”</p>

<p>“Ah! and you told me you had made up your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
mind to renounce your errors, and to believe all that I
believe. That was not a dream?”</p>

<p>“No, a reality.&mdash;You must compose yourself.”</p>

<p>“And then we made it up&mdash;was that it?”</p>

<p>“Just so.”</p>

<p>“And loved each other as we used when we were
first married.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;just so.”</p>

<p>“And you said I had been deceived as to your connection
with....”</p>

<p>María turned her head and fixed her eyes on her
husband’s face.</p>

<p>“We will not discuss the past,” he said kindly.
“We must make an effort to restore you to health, and
you must help us, María.”</p>

<p>“Help you, what to do?”</p>

<p>“To save you, María.”</p>

<p>“Aye indeed! I must try to save myself! My
God! I have sinned....” She was overcome with
grief.</p>

<p>“I am speaking of your life&mdash;of your bodily health
which is in danger.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I do not care for the health of my body, but
for that of my soul which is in peril.... A little while
ago, I do not exactly know how long, I thought I was
dead. Now I am alive; but I think I shall die soon ...
and I am in mortal sin.”</p>

<p>“You dreamt it, my child, it was a dream. Be calm,
do not frighten yourself.”</p>

<p>“In mortal sin,” repeated María putting her hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
to her head. “Tell me did I dream then that you told
me...?”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“That you did not love me?”</p>

<p>“What could it be, but a dream?”</p>

<p>María threw her arms round her husband’s neck and
gently drew his face down to her own.</p>

<p>“Say it again that I may get rid of the miserable
impression of that horrible dream.” They exchanged a
few words in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Then give me a proof of your affection,” said
María. “As we are a long way from Madrid, and as I
cannot go out for some days, send a message for me to
Padre Paoletti. I want to talk to him.”</p>

<p>“I will fetch him myself.”</p>

<p>“You yourself?”</p>

<p>“Why not? I don’t mind taking any trouble to
gratify you.”</p>

<p>In the course of the day the doctor came. Leon
had thought it prudent to confide to him some of his
secrets, for, as María’s attack had been brought on by
mental excitement, it was necessary that the physician
should be aware of the delicate details. Moreno Rubio
and Leon Roch were close friends; their intimacy was
founded on sympathies of character, and on common
grounds of scientific views and interests. That morning,
when Leon had disclosed to his friend such facts as
were indispensable to a sure diagnosis, they had a conversation
of which some important fragments may be
recorded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>“So that in short you do not care for your wife&mdash;neither
more nor less,” said Rubio, who liked to state
facts as plainly as possible.</p>

<p>“I have always had a horror of falsehood,” replied
Leon. “And I am bound to confess that María does
not inspire me with any affectionate emotion. I have
two feelings when I think of her: one is the deepest
pity; the other is a certain amount of respect.”</p>

<p>“Precisely; but those feelings are not enough to
make a good husband; however, there are others in
your soul which might make you&mdash;and assuredly do
make you a kind-hearted man. Tell me, do you wish
your wife to live?”</p>

<p>Leon started like a man who has been struck.</p>

<p>“Such a question is an insult. The very disquietude
of my conscience impels me to desire that María should
not die.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Then if you wish that María should
live,” said Moreno, laying his hand on his friends’
shoulder, “the first indispensable thing is to soothe the
irritation produced by her jealousy&mdash;which, unfortunately,
is but too well-founded; her mind has received a
terrible shock, and it must be allowed to recover its
balance. Every life has, as it were a rhythm, a beat, of
its own, to which it goes on regularly and smoothly. A
sudden and complete disturbance of the measure may
result in the gravest consequences, even in death. We
have here an instance in point. We must therefore lay
ourselves out to restore as quickly, and as effectually as
possible, the steady measure that has been disturbed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
then we can deal with the frightful blow to the nervous
system which has affected, and may be fatal to the
brain. All these jealousies must be eliminated as quickly
as possible, so that her feelings not being excited, the
whole machine may have a chance of recovering its
tone and balance. All the scenes which gave rise to
her attack must by degrees be effaced from her memory.
If she lives there will be time enough to let her know
the truth. She must be saved from any fresh outbreaks
of anger or despair by being persuaded that nothing
has occurred; and above all, my dear friend, you must
treat her like a sick child; give her every thing she asks
for and indulge all her whims, particularly as concerns
anything that may divert and occupy her mind. Your
wife&mdash;I am well aware&mdash;will claim your love and devotion:
it is impossible to restrict her in her demands.”</p>

<p>It was after this that Leon raised the question of removing
his wife from Suertebella; but Rubio positively
negatived the proposal.</p>

<p>Having abandoned this idea as homicide&mdash;that was
the word employed by Moreno&mdash;they agreed to dismantle
the room, to send to Madrid for the servants
who were in the habit of waiting on María and for
various trifles which would answer the purpose of carrying
out the illusion. Before they parted Leon said to
his friend.</p>

<p>“Answer me frankly. Will my wife die?”</p>

<p>“It is impossible to say. It may yet end fatally.
You must leave me to ascertain precisely the kind of
trouble with which we have to contend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening, when María was herself again, after
going through her visions of a hell full of hideous
machines and toiling demons, Moreno came in as was
previously mentioned.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” he exclaimed, smiling as he found the
husband and wife in such close proximity. “Like two
turtle-doves! And how is my patient?&mdash;A good pulse;
but we must have rest, absolute rest of body and
mind.”</p>

<p>María looked at her husband and frowned.</p>

<p>“No, no. You are not to look so cross at this good
man who is as devoted to you as a newly-married
lover. You will see&mdash;in a few days you will be able
to go out together to smell the lilacs, and watch the butterflies.
A sensible woman ought never to listen to
spiteful gossip. When people are envious what can they
do but talk nonsense? Now, my dear lady, you are
going to be perfectly rational and calm; we are going
to sign a permanent peace and be very fond and loving....
I say it for you both.... Well, let me see your
tongue.”</p>

<p>Then he himself mixed a draught, Leon and
Rafaela helping him.</p>

<p>While this was going forward in the sick room the
Marquis de Fúcar, setting aside for a moment the great
business of the loan, already almost concluded, went to
join his daughter, and said with a grave face:</p>

<p>“Rubio’s anticipations are very serious. I am
afraid we shall have a terrible calamity under our roof.
However, we must not despair; science can do much,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
and God can do more. All we can do is to help
science to the best of our little power, and to implore
the intervention of Providence.”</p>

<p>Pepa, raising her anxious eyes to look at her father
lifted a face so pale that it was death-like; and with
the desperation of a person who tears open a wound
that it may bleed more freely, she asked:</p>

<p>“Is she dying?”</p>

<p>“That was what I was telling you, and you did not
listen,” said Don Pedro, who was also suffering from a
wound. “It is only our duty to show our unfortunate
guest how deeply we sympathise in his misfortune.
We must do something worthy of our house and name.
Do not you think it will be well to perform a religious
ceremony that may give due expression to our desire to
see María out of danger? We will do it on a scale of
magnificence. The chapel here stood me in eighty
thousand dollars&mdash;though it might have cost less if the
artists I employed had been men of less talent and pretensions.&mdash;Well
then, to-morrow I will have a solemn
penitential service, which all the servants and people
shall attend, with you at their head. I give you full
authority to spend as much as you think proper in
tapers. The worthy priest from Polvoranca shall celebrate
mass, and if you would like to have some more
priests, send to all that are within reach.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, he sighed deeply and left her.
Was it that, having a heavy burthen on his own soul,
he yearned to petition the favour and mercy of Heaven
on his own behalf? But we do not know what were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the troubles which had so suddenly transformed the
marquis’ radiant smiles into a sour grimace of annoyance.
The loan, after crossing the troubled waters of
the Spanish bourse with a fair wind, would this very
day reach the haven of realization; and it was quite
certain that Fúcar, Soligny and a few other birds of the
same feather in Paris, Amsterdam, and London, would
haul in a handful of gold for interest, brokerage and
commission. What then...?</p>

<p>The chapel of Suertebella was a handsome edifice,
at one angle of the mansion; high-roofed, thick-walled,
and shining as if it had been varnished. The interior
was of stucco, full of imitations of coloured marbles and
porphyry, with a great deal of gilding on bosses and
mouldings, which produced the effect of a lavish display
of livery-buttons and gold cord on the pediments and
spandrils. The style of architecture can only be described
as Græco-Chino-Roman&mdash;Gothic gargoyles
combined with ornament of the new classical style
which originated at Munich, and which our architects
have adopted for the porticoes of our houses, the pantheons
of our cemeteries, the entrances of our town-halls,
and the dining-rooms of our millionaires. The
pseudojasper, gold, and brilliant colours dazzled the eye
till they all seemed to be swimming round and round
the dome like fishes in a glass bowl. The roof was
supported by highly respectable angels who, in the
sculptor’s studio, had played the part of seductive
nymphs; and the paintings in the dome represented
the cardinal Virtues, who had been predestined to figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
as Muses. Everything blazed with the glaring splendour
which is now fashionable in our private rooms,
and which in them is not out of place. There was not
a Christian attribute or allegory that had not been
evolved from the palette or the sculptor’s mould by the
artists employed to decorate this chapel. We shall
presently become acquainted with a ribald jester who,
it was said, was one day giving a farcical, not to say a
sacrilegious explanation of the figures that adorned it:
This female figure with bandaged eyes and a chalice in
her hand, represented Spain whom the financiers of
state had blindfolded that she might not see the bitterness
of her cup of ruin; that one, leaning on an anchor,
with her eyes disconsolately turned up to Heaven, was
Commerce in despair; and the matron caressing a
whole tribe of children was Beneficence, a pleasing emblem
of the interest taken by the Fúcars in property
and labour, and of the tender solicitude with which
they lent them a helping hand to the work-house. The
four Fathers of the Church, all represented as writing
very gravely with “The Eagle’s Quill,” personified the
Press, always ready to sing the praises of wealthy capitalists,
who, before acting on their own account, take
advantage of its ready pen. The vessel sinking in the
waves of Tiberias was the State, whose orators and
leaders suffer so much buffeting, while the Multiplication
of the Loaves was obviously prefigurative of the
distribution and reception of certain articles supplied
under contract; finally, the stolid Sibyls, sitting with
their hands before them in utter absence of mind, represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
government administration. And the irreverent
commentator went on to give new readings of the texts
that were inscribed on the fillets and architraves for the
edification of the faithful: “I am Pedro (Peter) and on
this stone I will build my house. Give unto me that
which is Cæsar’s, and that which is God’s.”</p>

<p>The chapel, the allowance being made for modern
taste in ecclesiastical architecture, was a handsome one.
It was on a level with the ground-floor, and there was
a second door to the garden by which the congregation
were admitted. The roof rose higher than that of the
house, displaying its bell-tower somewhat ostentatiously.
It was dedicated to San Luis Gonzaga&mdash;whose
image&mdash;a really fine piece of sculpture&mdash;stood
on the high altar beneath a large representation of Calvary.</p>

<p>The pious ceremony took place, as Don Pedro had
arranged. The sun had scarcely risen when wax
tapers innumerable were lighted on the high altar and
in the side chapels, and thousands of delicious flowers,
arranged in jars and vases, added their tribute of beauty
and perfume. The little sanctuary was, to use a vulgar
phrase, a blaze of splendour. The lights and odours
inspired a sort of fervour by stimulating the senses and
firing the imagination, so that sight and hearing were
powerfully excited. All the servants on the estate
were present, from the steward to the lowest scullion,
and from the head-gardener to the tiniest stable-boy.
The service was celebrated by the priest from Polvoranca,
a humble protégé of the great house; an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
man, somewhat ridiculous in appearance, uniting to the
most elaborate ugliness certain eccentricities and manias
which, though they had gone much against him in
his ecclesiastical career, had made him well known in
all the country side. He received from Don Pedro a
small salary for officiating every Sunday for the benefit
of the servants and women of the house, and hearing
them confess once a year&mdash;a pious formality that the
millionaire kept up, with a view to protecting himself
against peculation and domestic difficulties of various
kinds.</p>

<p>Pepa Fúcar attended the service in the gallery communicating
with the interior of the house; and with
her, her waiting-maid and Monina, who could not understand
why she was to be so quiet and good, and
was on the point of lifting up her voice with a loud
shout at the most solemn part of the service. Heaven
only knows what she might have said if the nurse had
not held her tightly, stopping her mouth, and threatening
her that God would punish her by taking away her
tongue. This had the desired effect, and Monina sat
patiently till the end.</p>

<p>Pepa Fúcar knelt on a stool and leaned over the
front of the balcony. Who can guess what was in her
mind during that solemn hour, or for what, in truth, her
aching soul petitioned?</p>

<p>The service ended, every one left the chapel, but
Pepa remained in her place without moving from the
attitude she had taken up from the beginning. With
her head bent over the cushion and her face half-hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
in her folded hands she had not breathed a word or a
sigh. When, at last, she looked up and prepared to
rise, she gazed fixedly at the altar without any definite
expression on her face; the cushion was wet with her
tears, as though a jug of water had been spilt over it.
She left the chapel and went towards her rooms; she
was silent and grave, her eyes were red, her lips parted
as if she must suffocate if she could not draw a deep
breath. At the door of her own room she met her
father.</p>

<p>Don Pedro, though he had not been present in
person at the service, had looked out on to the chapel
through a little window in the wall to the left, which
opened from a passage in the house, and was screened
by a figure of St. Luke the Evangelist. From thence
Fúcar could note that all his household were present
and that none were missing; he could admire the magnificence
of his private sanctuary&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la cathédrale pour
rire</i>, as our ribald jester called it&mdash;which in his eyes
was “a gem among basilicas” and “full of character.”
Indeed, it would have been difficult to refuse that modicum
of praise to the grand Christian scheme of decoration
worked out by one of the chief scene-painters
of the capital.</p>

<p>But we have reason to believe that the good man’s
mind rose above this to a loftier range of ideas. He
was deeply troubled that day, and no doubt, as he put
his solemn face out of the opening in such a manner
that it might have been taken for that of an Evangelist
or a Father of the Church, his feelings were reverent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and prayerful, and he craved something of the Creator.
Still, this is mere hypothesis and devoid of foundation;
it is put forward here for what it is worth, to fill up the
vacuum which must exist in a total absence of data.</p>

<p>This much, at any rate, is certain. He stopped to
say to his daughter:</p>

<p>“Every one was there.”</p>

<p>“And how is she this morning? Do you know?”
asked Pepa in a voice so husky that it sounded as
though her lungs, in their scorching thirst had consumed
the air they breathed.</p>

<p>“Be hopeful, my child. The unfortunate woman
passed a quieter night, and she is better, Moreno tells
me.”</p>

<p>“So that she will recover....”</p>

<p>“It is very probable....” said Don Pedro, but the
indifference of his tone showed that he was thinking of
something else. “Really, my child, it seems as though
God were piling every calamity on us at once!”</p>

<p>As he spoke the poor gentleman could not control
his feelings. He held out his arms to his daughter who
threw herself into them, and exclaimed in a voice
choked with agitation: “Child of my heart&mdash;my
jewel! How unfortunate you are!”</p>

<p>Pepa shed on her father’s shoulder the few tears she
had saved from the Mass. Don Pedro, commanding
himself, said with an effort: “But we must not exaggerate.&mdash;Nothing
is positive.&mdash;To-morrow....”</p>

<p>Pepa went into her own room and her father retired
to his, where, for the twentieth time, he read and re-read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
a number of letters and telegrams which had
made a deep impression on a mind usually as bright
and clear as the spring air and sunshine.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

LEON ROCH PAYS A VISIT.</h2>


<p class="mt3">Acting on a generous impulse, and being desirous
of fulfilling the promise he had made to his wife,
Leon Roch set out for Madrid and went to the church
of St. Prudencio in search of Father Paoletti. Nothing
could be more unlikely than that he should set foot in
such a place, and when the serving-brother had asked
him to wait in the bare parlour, he had leisure to reflect
on the matter and on himself, with a sort of incredulous
surprise, feeling as though either the place he was in or
he himself must be the creation of a dream. The man
who vows that he will never cross the threshold of some
particular door must be either very foolish or very
proud, or incapable of discerning that the swift turns
of life bring us in front of those portals&mdash;open them&mdash;and
push us in; and we do not even think of
escape.</p>

<p>Leon had not had much time for these reflections
when a priest stood before him; a singularly small man
of middle age, with a tiny, pale, boyish face, and such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
large inquisitive, piercing eyes, that, in fact, he seemed
all eyes. The deliberateness of his gait contrasted
strangely with the smallness of his person; his steps
were measured, even stately, with a firm, slow tread
such as might result from constantly wearing shoes
soled with lead. Paoletti bowed to his visitor with elegant
politeness, and Leon, who was in no mood for
ceremony, briefly explained his object. Paoletti, seating
himself in front of the weary infidel with the calm
tenacity of a humble believer, listened to him with the
benevolence of a father confessor, cast down his eyes,
knit his fingers, and twirled his thumbs&mdash;his hands it
may be noted were as slender and delicate as those of
a fine lady.</p>

<p>“Let us go,” he said looking up and stopping the
rotation of his thumbs. “I have heard of her journey
to Carabanchel and of her illness, but I did not know that
it was serious, nor that she had been carried to Suertebella.&mdash;To
the house itself?”</p>

<p>“To the house itself,” said Leon gloomily.</p>

<p>“I suppose then,” said Paoletti with a subtle intonation,
“that the marquis’ daughter has come to
Madrid with her darling child.”</p>

<p>“She is to do so to-day.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“I do not purpose leaving María so long as she is
ill.”</p>

<p>“You impress me very favourably, Señor,” said the
Italian, giving Leon his hand with a hearty gesture.
“At the same time your position with reference to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
blessed martyr is a strange one, and unpleasant for both
of you.”</p>

<p>“It is the singularity of our position,” said Leon,
“that made me decide on coming myself, that I might
give you certain items of information which concern no
one but me, and request your co-operation...”</p>

<p>“Mine?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;to help me to carry out my arrangements,
and get out of my difficulties as well as possible.”</p>

<p>Paoletti knit his brows. He had risen to start at
once; but he now sat down again, and once more began
to twirl his thumbs.</p>

<p>“In the first place,” he said in the tone of a man
accustomed to drive matters home, “explain to me the
motives which brought you here. It is strange enough
that you should come to confess to me, surely?” And
he smiled with sarcastic triumph in a way that to Leon
was more offensive than open mockery would have
been.</p>

<p>“To confess?&mdash;yes indeed!”</p>

<p>“No, no, Señor,” said Paoletti with an affectation of
sweetness which betrayed his Italian blood, “I do not
expect you to confess&mdash;far from it! you will neither
lay bare your conscience, nor retract your errors. You
will only tell me what I know already&mdash;what every one
knows. And all in order that I may help you...”
And the priest ended his sentence by quoting the reports
diffused by Pilar de San Salomó’s gossiping
circle.</p>

<p>“In all that there is a little truth and a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of falsehood,” said Leon. “It is false to say that
Monina is my child; it is false to accuse me of such a
connection with Pepa Fúcar. That I love her is true&mdash;and
that every kind of love for my unhappy wife is
dead within me. I have no feeling left for her but calm
regard, and a dispassionate respect for her virtues which
I fully acknowledge.”</p>

<p>“Regard, respect!” said Paoletti. “Appreciation of
her virtues!... This, Sir, is something. The pure and
noble soul of María Egyptiaca deserves more, much
more, it is true; but if we might hope that your regard
and respect would develop and expand....” Again he
took Leon’s hand in his own which was as white and
cold as marble&mdash;“we might bring about a reconciliation.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” said Leon. “Utterly, totally impossible.
A little while since it would have been easy&mdash;but
what effort did she make to effect it?&mdash;You ought
to know.”</p>

<p>The little man looked at the ground and nodded
affirmatively.</p>

<p>“Of course! you know all about it!” said Leon bitterly.
“My wife’s conscience-keeper, the ruler of my
household, the master of my married life, who has held
the sacred chain in his hand and could bind or unloose&mdash;the
man whom I see now for the first time since he
came to see my hapless brother-in-law, Luis Gonzaga,
who died in my house&mdash;this man who, though it is no
earthly concern of his, has secretly disposed of my happiness
and of my life as a master does of his purchased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
slaves.&mdash;You, I say, must of course, know everything.”</p>

<p>“This worldly tone of haughty philosophy is well
known to me too, Señor,” said Paoletti, in a tone of
apostolic reproof. “If you wish me to meet you on
that ground and to confute you utterly I will do so.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I did not come here to argue. The horrible
struggle is over&mdash;I am beaten, after having risked
honour and delicacy, after fighting with skill, nay, and
with fury. My opinions were settled long since, and
cannot now be altered. This is not the moment for
discussion; we are in presence of a terrible fact.”</p>

<p>“María then is dying?”</p>

<p>Leon told Paoletti of his wife’s visit to his lodgings,
and of the scene which culminated in the fainting fit
and subsequent illness of the saintly María.</p>

<p>There was a pause; then Paoletti said severely:</p>

<p>“It is clear to me that María loves you, and that
you are the real traitor to the contract&mdash;guilty to-day
as you were yesterday and from the beginning. Without
further knowledge of the facts, I cannot pronounce on
the step taken by my beloved daughter; but such a step,
such a proceeding, taken as it stands, argues that she
still loves you, and that her tender soul is full of sweetness
and kindness for a man who is wholly undeserving
of them.”</p>

<p>“You, who know everything, know very well that
my wife no longer loves me; and if those who are incapable
of judging of a pure and noble feeling choose
to give the name of love to a sentiment that has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
title to it, I shall at once assert myself as the sole judge
of my unhappy wife’s feelings, and declare that they do
not satisfy my demands, that I repudiate them, and put
them out of court in deciding on the question of separation
or reunion.”</p>

<p>Paoletti stood lost in thought.</p>

<p>“There is no fundamental and moral bond between
us,” Leon went on. “María and I are two separate
souls: in my mind I see her and myself as the very
idea incarnate of divorce.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;a group of statuary&mdash;a work of art!” said
Paoletti, a lightning shaft of malice flashing across the
dark cloud of his austerity.</p>

<p>“Well, yes&mdash;a work of art&mdash;which did not originate
spontaneously, mark you, but was somebody’s
doing, somebody’s work. My wife does not love me.
I believe she might have loved me as I hoped, if the
grave faults of her character, instead of diminishing and
vanishing under my authority and tenderness, had not
become more marked under alien influences. She does
not love me; I do not love her. Consequently any
reconciliation is out of the question.”</p>

<p>“You cannot say,” added the priest, with some severity,
tempered however by tolerance, “that I have
not listened to you with patience.”</p>

<p>“Patience! I have had much longer patience!”</p>

<p>“Even those who have it least retain with it a
touch of the Christian about them, caballero.&mdash;Then
the long and short of it, Señor de Roch, is that you do
not love your wife and she does not love you&mdash;you respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and regard her.&mdash;But what is the upshot of it
all? Or to put it plainly, what did you come here
for?”</p>

<p>“María begged me to fetch her confessor. Far
from opposing her I consented with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Then let us go at once!” said Paoletti rising.</p>

<p>“The most important thing is yet to come,” said
Leon laying his hand on the priest’s robe. “You, with
your perspicacity will at once perceive that I need not
have come myself merely to fetch you. I came to tell
you what no one else could tell you. Consider in the
first place that her mind is the part really affected.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“I ought to tell you that I honestly desire that she
should recover,” said Leon with firm composure. “I
call God to witness that this is the truth: I hope and
wish, without any kind of mental reservation, that my
wife may live.”</p>

<p>“I perfectly understand; you wish that she should
get well again&mdash;that her nervous excitement should be
soothed and removed, and to that end nothing must be
suggested to her that can remind her of the cause of
her illness. Comforting and pleasing ideas must be
kept before her, to help her to disentangle the confusion
caused by her indignation and unsatisfied passions;
my spiritual guidance must be qualified by a certain
infusion of worldly tact, so as to foster her illusions and
conceal the sad truth,&mdash;the father-confessor must be to
some extent a physician, allaying jealousy and encouraging
hope, so as to clutch back, as it were, the life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
that is fluttering to escape&mdash;that will escape, beyond
recall, if the mental excitation that has imperilled it is
not promptly banished.”</p>

<p>Leon admired the confessor’s sagacity.</p>

<p>“Very good,” Paoletti went on; “I will do my
best. I cannot pledge myself without knowing more
exactly in what spiritual frame of mind my beloved
daughter may be.”</p>

<p>“María is at Suertebella.”</p>

<p>“So I understand.”</p>

<p>“She must on no account be made aware of it.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;let that pass&mdash;” said Paoletti looking at
the ground and screwing up his mouth. “It is a subterfuge
which I hold excusable.”</p>

<p>“She insists on displaying the affection which now&mdash;rather
late in the day&mdash;she feels for me.”</p>

<p>“Nor does that seem to me blamable. It may be
allowed, considering that you think very little of her
affection.”</p>

<p>“While María is ill she must not be allowed to
fancy that I care for any other woman.”</p>

<p>“Stay, stay,” said Paoletti, putting up his white
hand as if to screen himself. “This is going too far.
I have slipped some rather thick threads through the
eye of the needle but the camel, my dear Sir, the camel
is too much for me. That is a gross imposition.”</p>

<p>“It is common charity.”</p>

<p>“Truth forbids it.”</p>

<p>“Her health requires it.”</p>

<p>“A mere physical necessity to which we must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
attach too much importance. My saintly daughter
will die as a Christian should, contemning the baser
and more worldly passions.”</p>

<p>“It is always our first duty to guard against death.”</p>

<p>“Always, if we can do so without baseness. Am I
to allow that angelic martyr to believe in her husband’s
innocence when she is actually under the same roof
as her rival? I will grant you that there may be nothing
existing to insult or injure her while she, the unhappy
wife, is breathing her last. Still, the frightful
fact remains.&mdash;I will tell her nothing unless she asks,
but if she questions me&mdash;and she will, she will!”</p>

<p>“You are right!” exclaimed Leon struck by this
solemn appeal. “It is a farce, equally unworthy of her
and of me. The truth terrifies me&mdash;the lie disgusts
me; but the truth is certain death, and the lie possible
recovery.&mdash;Do not come to Suertebella. I will find
a priest&mdash;anybody&mdash;the vicar of the parish, or the
house chaplain.”</p>

<p>He was leaving the room when Paoletti called him
back in a conciliatory tone.</p>

<p>“You must be fully aware,” he said, “that the
presence of no other confessor will have the same effect
as mine. If you will pledge yourself not to interfere in
any particular, I will go with you with pleasure, to
comfort and help the hapless sufferer. Nay, more,” he
added with a burst of feeling, “I may tell you frankly
that I earnestly wish to go. She is so saintly, so admirable!
I not only admire and respect her&mdash;I look
up to her as a superior being.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what will you tell her?”</p>

<p>“What it is my duty to tell her,” replied the Italian
fixing a pair of eyes on Leon’s face, which might have
been a hundred pairs. “It strikes me as strange that
a man who declares that he had thrown off every matrimonial
tie, should trouble himself so much about his
wife’s conscience.”</p>

<p>“I am not anxious about her conscience, but about
her health,” said Leon who was getting very weary.</p>

<p>“You tell me you do not love her, nor she you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But it is her person&mdash;her mortal part, that a man
may claim, not her exquisite conscience.”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” said Leon, draining the cup. “I
leave her conscience to you, who have made it. I have
no wish to put in a claim for the monstrosity.”</p>

<p>“I forgive you the word,” said Paoletti looking
down. “Now Señor&mdash;Yes or No.”</p>

<p>“Do you intend to kill her?”</p>

<p>“I!” and then, with a sigh, he added: “We will ask
her who it is that has killed her?”</p>

<p>Leon’s heart sank within him; after a moment’s reflection
he stamped his foot. A stamp sometimes strikes
out an idea as a spark may flash from an iron shoe.
Leon had an idea.</p>

<p>“Let us go, at any rate,” he said. “I will leave so
delicate a matter to your own conscience.”</p>

<p>“And to prove worthy of your confidence,” said
the priest, unable to conceal his satisfaction, “I may
promise you to reconcile truth and prudence as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
lies in my power, and to do my utmost not to agitate
the last hours&mdash;if the Lord so wills it&mdash;of my precious
daughter in the Church. I am perfectly certain that my
presence will be the greatest comfort to her.”</p>

<p>“Come then.”</p>

<p>“I am at your service in an instant,” said Paoletti,
hastening as much as he could with his heavy step to
fetch his hat and cloak. But pausing in the door-way
he observed: “it is very early; you, perhaps have
not had breakfast. Will you have some chocolate?”</p>

<p>“No thank you,” said Leon bowing. “No indeed.”</p>

<p>And an hour later they got out of the carriage at
the door of Suertebella.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />

A PARTING.</h2>


<p class="mt3">The penitential mass had been celebrated, and Paoletti
had gone into the room where his saintly daughter
lay dying in alternate torments of fever and doubt,
when Leon, hurrying from room to room, went in
search of Pepa. He found her at last in Ramona’s
room. He had something very important to say to her
and it might be supposed that Pepa was expecting this,
for she was standing breathless, with her eyes fixed on
the door, listening for his footstep, and as he entered
she went a few paces towards a recess in the room,
suggesting to him by the expression of her steps&mdash;for
steps, too, have a language of their own&mdash;that they
would talk more at their ease there than anywhere else.
Monina ran to meet him and threw her arms round his
legs, looking up in his face. He took her up, and the
child, finding herself perched so high, began teasing
him to admire the artistic beauties of a small clay vase
with a handle and spout, a recent gift from the priest of
Polvoranca, and then amused herself by holding on to
his ear.</p>

<p>“Monina, be quiet&mdash;do not be troublesome,” said
her mother. “I know&mdash;yes I know what you have
come to say.&mdash;Child be quiet; come to me.”</p>

<p>She took Monina from Leon’s arms and held her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
her own. “You need not tell me; I understand&mdash;I
know&mdash;I must go away. I had made up my mind to
it, even if I were forced to leave without seeing you.”</p>

<p>“I appreciate your delicacy,” said Leon. “Yes, go
to your house in Madrid, and for the present forget my
existence.”</p>

<p>“That I can hardly do.&mdash;Child, you are choking
me,” said Pepa to Monina who was now pulling her
mother’s ear. “Get down and run away.&mdash;But I will
go, without even asking when I am to see you again. I
dread to ask and I feel for you in having to give me a
reply.”</p>

<p>Leon looked down and said nothing. There was
not a kind word, a friendly formality, a common expression
of hope even, which, on his lips, would not require
a criminal accent. Silence seemed to him more
decorous than any protestation of purity of purpose.
They both were speechless for some little time, not daring
to look at each other, each dreading to read the
other’s face and knowing that it would reflect his&mdash;or
her&mdash;own feelings.</p>

<p>“Ask me nothing&mdash;tell me nothing&mdash;do not utter
even a name that can appeal to her,” Leon said at
length. “Keep your heart full of generous feeling, and
dismiss all hope.”</p>

<p>Pepa wanted to say something, but her voice was so
tremulous that she could not: “Nothing will be left
me,” she thought to herself, “nothing but the old dreary
miserable thought: she will pray and pray&mdash;and live;
I, hoping and still hoping, shall die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Leon who seemed to read her thoughts in her contracted
brow, said, looking into her face:</p>

<p>“It is in critical moments that the generosity or
selfishness of a soul is revealed.”</p>

<p>Pepa was trembling in every limb; she propped her
head on one hand, and looking down at her knees, on
which Ramona’s tiny fingers were playing a tune, she
said:</p>

<p>“I do not know whether mine is generous or selfish.
I only know that I shed many tears just now in praying
that God would let no one die for my happiness.
How bitter our prayers can sometimes be! How cruelly
our thoughts can torture us in the effort to prevent the
flowers we must pluck and cast out turning into snakes!
I have prayed more to-day than in any one day of my
life before; but I cannot be sure of having prayed
rightly and from a pure heart. The battle raged within
me; I believe that the words I used had a different
meaning every minute&mdash;that the name of God meant
the Devil&mdash;that love meant hate, and life stood for
death. The feeling and the thought were struggling for
the mastery and each tried to find expression in words.&mdash;I
did not really pray, I was not really good; and
yet, indeed, indeed, I meant to be. I am so much a
woman, so little of a saint.&mdash;But I shall not feel so
wicked when I have found courage enough to pray
clearly and boldly that we may both die&mdash;then everything
will come right....”</p>

<p>She rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>“In short,” she said, “I am going. You know that
my only joy in life is to obey you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks&mdash;thanks...” murmured Leon, taking up
Monina.</p>

<p>“Say good-bye,” said Pepa, fixing a tender gaze on
the child and the man who held her.</p>

<p>Leon held the little girl in a close embrace and kissed
her again and again; such demonstrations of affection,
he reflected, could hardly be deemed a scandal when
bestowed on this angel-baby. He carried her up and
down the room two or three times to conceal the emotion
which, rebelling against every moral effort, was
too legible in his face; and though he did not glance at
the mother, she, sitting in her corner, might be sure
that he was conscious of her presence. Passion has the
keenest sight, and wonderful skill in discovering the
thoughts of the object of its devotion, in assimilating
them and extracting nutriment from this exciting but
ethereal food.</p>

<p>As to the unhappy man himself, never had he so
deeply felt as at this moment the irresistible charm of
this sweet little creature&mdash;the child of a woman who was
not his wife, and of a man whom he detested. He felt
as if it would be impossible to part from this treasure
and live&mdash;not that it was his, though he had accustomed
himself to regard it as very much his own. His
love for the child was as inseparable from the image of
its mother as two stars that give but one light. It was
an adopted affection which usurped in his solitary soul
the vacant hearth and warming fire that ought to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
been for another. Was it his fault if in his weary journeying
across the waste these two faces smiled upon
him, one all dimples and the other all love, brightening
the melancholy horizon of life and encouraging him to
walk on, even when his strength was failing him, and
he stumbled over the stones and thorns. In Pepa he
had found affection, gentleness and a confiding nature&mdash;a
mysterious promise of the peace he had dreamed of,
the happiness he had so vainly and so painfully sought.
It was the ideal family, with every human element in it
except, alas! legitimacy; and the very fact of its being
only a vision and not a reality, gave it added enchantment
and greater attractions. Pepa’s passionate devotion,
and the tenacity which made her give it the pre-eminence
over every other feeling, far from causing him
any anxiety, altogether bewitched him; he saw in it the
offering of her whole heart without reserve, the incalculating
generosity which prompts a soul to abandon
itself wholly without any concealment, without cloking
its faults or veiling a single thought. Those who have
been beggars for love cannot repel that which flows in
their way, though the tide be too strong and boils and
foams. At the same time he felt a sort of pride and
pious emotion as he saw that this noble heart, without
ceasing to be duteously religious, was nevertheless his,
by a supreme law of humanity; and feeling himself so
beloved&mdash;so completely the lord and master of her
thoughts he could do no less than give his heart wholly
to her. That secondary and long-past affection that he
had known before the dawn of the glory in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
now saw each other faded into nothingness, as the stars
do at sunrise.</p>

<p>However, this was not the moment for such reflections.
Leon set the child on her mother’s knee and
said:</p>

<p>“Not another instant! Good-bye. If I find it
necessary to explain your absence to your father I will
venture to tell him all about it.”</p>

<p>“I will tell him myself.”</p>

<p>And they precipitately left the room by different
doors.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_X">CHAPTER X.<br />

BREAKFAST.</h2>


<p class="mt3">The historian does not feel it a serious lapse of duty
not to have mentioned already that the Tellerias flew
to Suertebella as soon as they heard of María’s serious
illness. It is so much a matter of course that the reader
will have taken it for granted, though this truthful narrative
has not spoken of it in so many words. A thing
which it is necessary to state, in case posterity&mdash;always
inquisitive and impertinent&mdash;cares to know, is that on
the morning of that eventful Tuesday&mdash;the day of the
penitential mass, of Paoletti’s visit, and of Pepa’s departure&mdash;the
marquesa with her husband and Polito,
heard, with blank astonishment, this emphatic decision
pronounced by Leon Roch:</p>

<p>“You cannot see María!”</p>

<p>“Not to-day even? I can hardly believe my ears!”
exclaimed Milagros, unable to command her indignation.
“To forbid a mother who has come to see her
sick child!”</p>

<p>“And me, her father!”</p>

<p>Polito said nothing, but whipped his trousers with
the cane he held in his hand.</p>

<p>“What reason can you have for such a proceeding?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can find a reason when I want to give one,” said
Leon.</p>

<p>“I demand to go in and see my daughter, to nurse
her, sit with her....”</p>

<p>“I nurse her and sit with her.”</p>

<p>“And you give us no reason, no explanation of such
atrocious cruelty, Good God!” exclaimed the marquis
looking solemn&mdash;which is as much as to say that he
looked very comical.</p>

<p>Leon enlarged on María’s extremely delicate mental
condition, and of his fears of the consequences of
some indiscretion if he allowed her family to see her.</p>

<p>“Is she alone now?”</p>

<p>“Her confessor is with her.”</p>

<p>The marquesa drew her son-in-law aside. “Really,”
she said, “I could not have believed that you would
go to such an extreme. Tell me, explain to me all the
horrors that have taken place here.... Ah! my poor
unhappy daughter does not even know, I daresay, that
she is under the same roof as her husband’s mistress....
And you are afraid lest I should open her eyes, lest she
should learn the truth from my lips&mdash;for from me she
always hears the truth, spontaneously and naturally&mdash;for
I do not know how to act, how to affect anything.”</p>

<p>“No madam, I am not afraid,” said Leon, only
anxious to end the discussion. “But you will not see
your daughter till she is quite well again.”</p>

<p>“And what right have you over the wife you have
betrayed and neglected? Or have you repented? Do
you wish?...”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Her tone and expression suddenly changed. The
angry scowl vanished like a cloud before the sun; her
eyes sparkled with youthful eagerness, and the bird in
her hat almost seemed to flutter in its gauzy nest.</p>

<p>“You have some plan for a reconciliation?” she
said in bitter-sweet tones. “If so, I am the last person
to wish to interfere with them. And if it is the outcome
of sincere repentance....”</p>

<p>“I have no plan for reconciliation; it is out of the
question,” said her son-in-law shortly as the Marquis de
Fúcar came into the room.</p>

<p>The master of the house, putting aside his cares and
anxieties to fulfil the duties of hospitality and do the
honours of his splendid house, came to make his bow
to the Tellerias and condole with them on María’s illness,
begging them to consider the house at their disposal
as long as it might suit them to stay. And as the
melancholy cause of their visit was not a matter of a
few hours, the open-handed gentleman, anxious to give
his hospitality a character worthy of his European
notoriety, begged the trio to remain the day&mdash;to pass
the night&mdash;to stay the next day and the next night, for
as long as they might wish; pressed them to breakfast&mdash;lunch&mdash;dine&mdash;sup;&mdash;to
sit down and rest, to lie
down and sleep&mdash;to make themselves completely at
home, since here were tables, a larder, a cellar and servants&mdash;rooms
enough to hold half the human race&mdash;horses
to ride&mdash;flowers to pluck&mdash;etc., etc.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, thank you! How good you are!”</p>

<p>And María’s mother pressed Fúcar’s hand in speechless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
emotion. On such occasions, silence, a glance to
Heaven, a silent clasp of the hand are more eloquent
than a hundred phrases in praise of the generosity of
those “who allow us to forget that we live in an age
tainted by Materialism.” The lady endeavoured to
give her face the expression which, in her own opinion,
was most becoming to her peculiar style of beauty, or
rather to those faded remains of it which were not yet
devoid of brilliancy when art, dress, sentiment, and judicious
gesture set them in the most becoming light.
In talking on indifferent subjects with her host she contrived
to lead him into a sentimental vein with so much
grace and persuasiveness that the stock-broker listened
to her with enchantment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Telleria had led Leon to a window,
and was saying to him with ponderous dignity:</p>

<p>“Matters have come to such a pass, and your behaviour
is apparently so preposterous, that I really
must insist on your giving me a satisfactory explanation;
otherwise it will be necessary to take it up on the
ground....”</p>

<p>“On the ground of honour!” said Leon sarcastically.
“But you see it would be difficult for you and me to
meet on that ground.”</p>

<p>“A father-in-law, of course.&mdash;It is not that I have
any wish to augment the scandal by adding another and
a worse one. We have the greatest confidence in your
gentlemanly feeling, and that Castilian nobility which
we Spaniards can never wholly belie, even if we wish
it. And if God should touch your heart, and you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
to effect a permanent reconciliation with my beloved
daughter....”</p>

<p>“That I shall never do.”</p>

<p>“Very well.&mdash;Then....” The marquis looked at
his son-in-law with an eye which&mdash;considering the
serio-comic aspect of the man&mdash;might fairly be called
terrible.</p>

<p>“Then I know how to act.”</p>

<p>They were in a Chinese boudoir full of figures
frightful enough to give nightmares. On its painted
walls, amid sporting butterflies, were gilt dwarfs and
monsters, meditative storks, platforms with impossible
stairs, trees that looked like hands, and faces that
looked like wafers. The human figures did not stand
on their ill-shaped feet; the trees had no roots; the
houses were as much in the air as the birds. There
was no solid ground; everything was suspended ’twixt
earth and heaven on a background of shining black,
like a sky of ink. The vacuous Chinese faces, looking
on with stolid impartiality, seemed to be making their
own reflections on the living scene, and the gold and
silver butterflies amused the fancy with a sort of reflection
on those dream-like walls, of the Marquis de Telleria’s
ambiguous smile. Chocolate-coloured bronzes
stood in every corner and on every table; and those
solemn idols&mdash;melancholy, hideous, dropsied and
gloomy&mdash;might have been the embodiment of Don
Agustin de Sudre’s grievances and woes.</p>

<p>It was like turning over a leaf in a picture book to
go from this Chinese apartment into the billiard-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
an Arab divan, where Leopoldo with a tube for inhaling
tar between his teeth, as if it were a cigar, was amusing
himself with practising the game.</p>

<p>A footman came into the room.</p>

<p>“Did you ring, Sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the young man without looking up,
“bring me some beer.”</p>

<p>The servant was leaving the room when Polito
called after him to ask if breakfast would soon be
ready.</p>

<p>“In a few minutes, Sir.”</p>

<p>And he went on playing with the balls.</p>

<p>The master of the house had left the Chinese boudoir
to his visitors, and a pompous, red-faced maître
d’hotel, picked up in some Paris café, who might have
passed for an English lord but for his smooth servility
and obsequious nervousness, waited on the lady to take
her orders.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed. “A mere trifle&mdash;anything
will do for me.&mdash;Have you any potted shrimps?
No?&mdash;never mind. But I cannot eat anything smoked.
A beef steak, not overdone.”</p>

<p>“And do not forget,” said her husband to this benevolent
official, whose black frock-coat was emblematic
of the Christian grace of hospitality. “Do not
forget that we drink nothing but Sauterne.”</p>

<p>Fúcar presently reappeared, still melancholy, but in
a great hurry, proving that sorrows are not incompatible
with an appetite. It was late and the whole party
were in need of food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tellerias and Don Onésimo, who made his appearance
after they had begun, did honour&mdash;in gastronomic
cant&mdash;to the marquis’ cook. Milagros, to
be sure, whether from fastidious elegance or because
grief had spoilt her appetite, hardly tasted anything.</p>

<p>“Do not let your anxiety be too much for you,”
said Don Pedro, “you must try to eat something. I
have much to worry me too&mdash;yet reason tells me I
must eat. Make an effort, and do likewise.”</p>

<p>The happy efforts of Don Pedro’s self-command
were amply proved by a slice of steak which he was
carrying morsel by morsel to his mouth, plentifully seasoned
with its own gravy, and butter and lemon.
Milagros after her oysters, only tasted and minced at
the food, but really ate nothing; while her husband
ate of every dish, savoury or sweet, first gazing at
them with a flattering smile and then paying them
treacherous attentions with his fork. Truffles, sausages,
and smoked tongue, with other trifles more filling than
digestible, tempted him to make acquaintance with
their charms.</p>

<p>“And Pepa?” asked Don Onésimo suddenly.</p>

<p>“At Madrid,” replied Fúcar, not lifting his eyes from
his plate, on which the remains of the steak might have
represented the treasury of Spain so much was it shrunk
in dimensions. A long silence ensued, interrupted at
last by Don Pedro himself, who again remarked to his
neighbour:</p>

<p>“My dear madame, my dear friend, it is our duty
to control our feelings.&mdash;Besides, it is not a desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
case, María is better to-day.&mdash;What, tears? Come,
come, just half a glass of Sauterne.”</p>

<p>The marquesa did not refuse. When she had swallowed
the wine she said:</p>

<p>“We shall see if my tiger of a son-in-law will allow
me to see my daughter this evening.”</p>

<p>Fúcar, anxious to avoid such a critical subject,
spoke of a report he had heard that Polito was about
to marry a rich Cuban heiress, whose family had lately
settled in the capital with all the ostentation and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i>
of an enormous fortune. The marquesa acknowledged
the report, and Leopoldo indirectly confirmed it with a
great deal of the false modesty that cloaks vanity.
The rumours were true as to the young man’s pretensions
and daily pursuit of the young lady on horseback
or on foot; but, in spite of these attentions, the engagement
was purely mythical, with nothing real about it
but the marquesa’s vehement ambition of seeing her
son possessed of a handsome and unencumbered fortune.
The young lady’s family, named Villa-Bojío,
though they were good friends of his mother’s were
averse to Leopoldo as a suitor; still, their opposition
was not very vehement, and Milagros laboured in silence,
with all the diplomacy and finesse of which she
was mistress, to turn this golden dream into at least a
silver reality.</p>

<p>Presently, the subject being exhausted, she rose
from table, and a servant offered the gentlemen the
finest cigars the world produces. This article&mdash;to
speak commercially&mdash;was the very choicest of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the good things in the millionaire’s house. His correspondents
at the Havana sent, for his private use,
the pick of their best, in return for the magic arts he
employed to coax the government into making the
rest of the nation consume the very worst. Matches
were struck and the smokers smacked their lips.</p>

<p>“Polito,” said Fúcar, “if you wish to ride tell Salvador
to saddle Selika for you.”</p>

<p>The smart rider of other people’s horses needed no
second bidding, but went down to the stables at once.
Don Pedro sighed and signed to the poorer marquises&mdash;one
noble by birth and one by his wits&mdash;who, following
the millionaire marquis, seemed to offer him a
sort of idolatrous worship, watching his glance, and
burning the incense of his own tobacco in his honour.
When they were alone Don Pedro confided to them in
a low voice and with a melancholy face an idea&mdash;a
piece of news&mdash;a fact. And thus, pouring the woes
of his anxious soul into the ears of his friends, the
worthy magnate found himself relieved; he breathed
more easily, and could even throw off a little joke and
laugh with that fat chuckle which we first heard at Iturburua.</p>

<p>“What a world we live in! What vicissitudes,
what unexpected reverses!&mdash;Then there is that foolish
tendency in human nature to exaggerate misfortunes
and regard them as irreparable....”</p>

<p>Onésimo, for his part, was completely stunned by
the information his noble friend had communicated.
He began to think that Don Pedro, utterly absorbed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
his complicated speculations and the metaphysics of
loans, had failed to understand the bearing of this
more vulgar dilemma. Telleria, on the contrary had
listened to Fúcar’s melancholy tale with a sense of sudden
joy, and had an idea of his own on the subject&mdash;happy
idea. This he fondly turned over in his mind
as he sat gazing at the painted walls of the dining-room,
decorated with a perfect deluge of dead game and
fish&mdash;partridges, hares, deer and lobsters, and a corresponding
deluge of fruit, vegetables, gourds and butterflies.
The carved oak panelling also displayed hunting-trophies
and emblems&mdash;pouting masks blowing
horns, dogs, birds hanging by the heads or heels; in
short so many representations of the animal and vegetable
kingdom that it might have been the palace of
indigestion.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />

THE PRIEST LIES AND THE COCK CROWS.</h2>


<p class="mt3">When María saw Padre Paoletti enter her room she
gave a cry of joy. She looked at him with affection
and then turned her eyes on Leon, expressing her
gratitude for this concession&mdash;which in truth was little
short of sublime&mdash;by holding out a hand to each.
This simple and natural action, without a spoken word,
was the epitome of her whole life, and might be regarded
as the synthesis of my story so far as she was
concerned. They asked her in the same breath how
she was feeling, and the same answer did for both.</p>

<p>“I think I must be better&mdash;I feel brighter.”</p>

<p>Leon patted her shoulder saying: “Then I will
leave you.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” exclaimed Padre Paoletti with eager
haste, seating himself at her left hand. “Doña María
and I are not going to discuss matters of conscience.
The doctor has satisfied us that her condition is not so
serious as to require any immediate care for the concerns
of her soul, nor is she strong enough for any long
dissertation on spiritual things which, though most
soothing and precious exhaust the attention. We will
all three talk together for a little while; yes, Señor,
all three of us&mdash;and presently, when her mind is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
calmer and clearer&mdash;all in good time&mdash;my precious
spiritual daughter can be left alone with me for a
few minutes.”</p>

<p>He ended with a smile which was reflected in
María’s face as the sea reflects the colour of the sky.</p>

<p>Paoletti, as will have been seen, was smooth-tongued
and affable; he could be both sensible and agreeable;
his appearance was modest and attractive, for besides a
pleasant face he had the added charm of the clearest,
sweetest and most pathetic voice that ever was heard.
His speech was at once soft and firm, with a mysterious
combination of two qualities that would seem to be antagonistic:
precision and dreaminess. An after-taste
of his native Italian, though partly effaced by the habit
of speaking Spanish, gave it a slightly plaintive cadence
which contrasted strangely with its vigorous inflections
and strongly accented consonants. Well aware of his
own skill in using the precious instrument that nature
had given him, he took every advantage of it, polishing
his language and suiting his words to his ideas and his
voice to his words with the greatest nicety. His love
of sonorous superlatives made his language tiresome.</p>

<p>While he talked he gave free play to the brilliancy
and mobility of his striking eyes; their various changes, I
might say phases, of expression seconded the eloquence
of his tongue. His glance seemed to prolong the impression
of his words: indeed it went further than
speech, where speech could not reach. It was to his
voice what music is to poetry. Of course there was
much art in the wonderful charm of these gifts; still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the chief source of it was a natural grace, and a long
habit of searching consciences, of reading faces, of surprising
secrets by a piercing glance or by a clenching
argument.</p>

<p>“From what our learned friend tells us,” he said,
“our beloved patient will soon be quite herself again.
It has been a nervous seizure which will pass away, and
her state will soon become normal. We are all liable to
the treacherous effects of sudden impressions which
raise a storm in the nervous system beyond the power of
reason to control. The Devil&mdash;always on the watch,
the flesh&mdash;rarely mortified as it should be, rise up and
assault us, taking us by surprise. On one hand we have
an illusion of the senses which not merely magnify, but
distort every object, on the other a fevered imagination
which wanders whither it ought not, and sees everything
in hues of fire and blood. The judgment succumbs
to a hallucination&mdash;a mere hallucination, my dear
daughter. Then comes the reaction, generally after a
severe attack of physical suffering, and we see things in
their true light; we see that our motives were inadequate,
that we made too much of some gossip&mdash;or perhaps
calumny, that we have seen visions and dreamed
dreams&mdash;yes, mere dreams.&mdash;Well, we will talk all
this over later. For the present try to rest, and bring
your mind to a state of exalted contemplation and
peace.&mdash;You seem very comfortably lodged here. I
admire your husband’s taste in retiring to such quiet
quarters. I like Carabanchel immensely. Doña María,
when you are able to get up again and your husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
takes you out&mdash;for of course you will take her out&mdash;you
will see what splendid wheat grows in the fields
about here.&mdash;It is a paradise for poultry too; you cannot
walk a yard without treading on the chickens.&mdash;Well,
this is sermon enough for to-day, Señora. We began
with the soul and ended with poultry. Well
well!”</p>

<p>At this moment they heard a cock crow.</p>

<p>“St. Peter’s cock!” said Paoletti in a low voice to
Leon. Then, looking quickly round at María he went
on:</p>

<p>“I began with thinking of your soul and ended
with the cocks and hens in the village. Another time
we will begin with the farm-yard and rise to Heavenly
things ... God be with you.”</p>

<p>“But are you really going?” said María sincerely
distressed.</p>

<p>“I will take a little walk and get something to eat
and come back later.”</p>

<p>“On no account,” said Leon. “You will eat something
here.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you, Doña María,” said Paoletti,
bending over the lady with a very mundane bow
and smiling familiarly. “Your husband is most kind.
I have never seen him since that melancholy time when
our dear Luis quitted this world for a better. It has
given me great pleasure to see him to-day.”</p>

<p>María looked at her husband with a mixed expression
of kindliness and aversion.</p>

<p>“Do you know, my dear lady,” he went on, “that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
to-day, by the most extraordinary coincidence, I discovered
something?”</p>

<p>“What?” asked María anxiously.</p>

<p>“We will talk of it by-and-bye&mdash;I do not want to
fatigue you.”</p>

<p>“No, do tell me,” said María in the plaintive tone
of a child who begs for something it ought not to
have.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I have discovered,” said the Italian,
lowering his voice as though he did not wish Leon to
hear, “that your husband is not so wicked as he seems;
that all you heard&mdash;all the thousand stories which I
know Doña Pilar told your mother&mdash;are a complete
mistake, a misapprehension&mdash;I am assured&mdash;do you
hear me?&mdash;I am assured that there never has been
any such infidelity....”</p>

<p>María’s eyes glittered with excitement and pride.
These words, which, coming from him were as Gospel
truth, fell on her tortured spirit like balm applied by
angel’s hands. She felt as though she were being lifted
from a black abyss into the light and fresh air of a
lovely day. Afterwards she brought mature reflection
to bear on these statements and to test them severely;
but for the moment the priest’s words had an immediate
effect on her penitential credulity. If Paoletti had
told her it was midnight, she would sooner have doubted
her own eyes than his statement. Without knowing
what to say or how to express her satisfaction she gazed
alternately at the priest and at her husband, clasping
their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” added Paoletti. “There is no
ground whatever for believing him to be unfaithful. My
friend here....”</p>

<p>But at this moment again they heard the cock crow,
and the priest broke off as though his voice failed him.
He recovered himself, however, and to change the subject
said:</p>

<p>“So now my sweet friend, you have only to get
well as soon as possible. Oh! what a beautiful service
you missed yesterday! When you get out again we will
show you some prints that came to us yesterday&mdash;and
we have a fresh supply of water from Lourdes.&mdash;But
I was forgetting; we have been eating the chocolate
you sent us. I must thank our kind benefactress in the
name of all the household.”</p>

<p>“It is nothing&mdash;a trifle, God knows!”</p>

<p>“Doña Perfecta was quite vexed with us because
we could not make use of her contribution. An angelic
creature, Doña Perfecta! What a beautiful soul!
And that poor Doña Juana. Last night she worried us
to death, and even called us despots because we have
forbidden the porter’s wife to make coffee for her and
the other devout women who rise very early to go to
communion and want to breakfast directly after. But
really the porter’s lodge was a perfect restaurant on
some Sundays.”</p>

<p>The doctor now came into the room.</p>

<p>“There is a great deal of talking here!” said he,
“I shall have to come in like a schoolmaster with a
cane and command silence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>“I&mdash;not another word! I believe I have talked
more than enough,” said the confessor. “I am going
to take a turn outside.”</p>

<p>He drew Leon into the recess of the window.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said.</p>

<p>“Admirable,” said Leon, who had fully appreciated
the priest’s dexterity&mdash;and again they heard the cock
crow.</p>

<p>“I have denied my God! I have connived at falsehood!”
said Paoletti with a smile that might mean compunction.
“If that cock continues to warn me with
that crow that seems sent by Heaven, I shall not be
able to hold out in this treason to my Master.”</p>

<p>“It is an act of charity,” replied Leon. “A cock
cannot be expected to understand that.”</p>

<p>“She, and God, will forgive me I trust. I have
never told her a lie or deceived her before&mdash;she has
never heard me utter a word that was not truth itself,
and she believes me implicitly.”</p>

<p>Leon stood silent for a minute after these words,
which revived forgotten pangs like a blow on an old
wound.</p>

<p>The physician gave a most hopeful report of his
patient.</p>

<p>“Do you hear what the doctor says?” asked the
priest in an undertone. “A good report, my dear sir&mdash;we
may feel sure that Doña María will be spared to
us.”</p>

<p>This possessive plural, used and repeated without
the slightest intention to wound, was the cruelest sarcasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
that Leon ever endured in the whole course of his
life. He had seen, and rejoiced to see, the miraculous
effect of the priest’s words on the hapless María; but
this familiarity with his wife, though strictly within the
limits of the charmed circle of spiritual affection, disgusted
him excessively. It was one of the fateful
moments of his life; he stood face to face with the overweening
authority, the absolute and omniscient dominion
with which he had been fighting in the dark during
the long years of his married life. It saddened him and
struck shame to his soul. Aye! That moral divorce of
which he had often spoken, and which he felt divided
them, had never been complete and final till this instant.
Till now he had still cherished esteem, respect; but
even these slender threads were now worn very thin, if
not actually broken, and soon, very soon, they must
give way.</p>

<p>Controlling all expression of this feeling he went
to his wife’s bedside and said:</p>

<p>“Señor Paoletti and I are going to get something
to eat. Rafaela will sit with you till we return.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! go and eat some breakfast,” said María
joyfully, and with a softer look in her eyes. “But do
not be long, I want to see you, and to talk to you.&mdash;Do
not forget that I must have you with me, that you
are not to leave me for an instant. Now that we have
the opportunity you will see what a scolding, what a
sermon, we can give you&mdash;Padre Paoletti and I. I
can see you already cowed and humiliated&mdash;poor
man! Miserable atheist!&mdash;But make haste; I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
to see you. Look; to-night we will have that sofa
placed here, close to the bed, so that you may sleep by
my side; then I shall sleep more quietly, and if I
should dream any nonsense I can put out my hand and
touch you, and then I shall rest in peace.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I will do all you wish,” said her husband,
torn in his mind while his heart was full of bitterness.</p>

<p>“And listen,” said María holding his sleeve. “See
that some one brings me to-day&mdash;at once&mdash;my rosary,
and my crucifix, and all my books of devotion off
the table in my room; all the books, every one, and the
water from Lourdes, and my relics, my precious relics.”</p>

<p>“Rafaela shall go to Madrid this afternoon and
bring you everything.”</p>

<p>“It is easy to see that this is an atheist’s room,”
said the sick woman reverting to the impertinent
phraseology which she had only forgotten under the
pressure of acute jealousy. “There is not a single religious
picture, not an image, nothing to betray that we
are Christian souls. However, go to breakfast, go and
eat. The good Padre has had no food to-day I daresay&mdash;poor
man! Give him the best of everything&mdash;do
you hear? The best. Confess your own inferiority
and humble yourself before him. Talk to him of me,
and learn to appreciate me better.”</p>

<p>Leon could hardly conceal a bitter smile as he left
the room; and once more that cock was heard to
crow.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />

THE STRIFE OF WORDS.</h2>


<p class="mt3">As soon as Fúcar heard the solemn tread of Padre
Paoletti’s leaden foot on the floors of his house, he hastened
to pay him the usual compliments, putting his
house, his table, and his servants at his disposal&mdash;his
carriages, chapel and treasures of art. It might have
been supposed, from the lavish generosity with which
he offered everything that could give joy and comfort
to necessitous humanity, that he was lord and master
over the whole created world. And bowing as low as
his burly dignity would allow he expressed, by his polite
subserviency, how inferior are all the riches and splendours
of the world to the humility of a simple priest,
who has no gala dress but his gown, and no palace but
his cell.</p>

<p>Paoletti, who was an accomplished connoisseur, not
only of the fine arts but of all the arts of life, complimented
his host on the magnificence of Suertebella,
thus giving the marquis a fair excuse for indulging his
favourite vanity, which was to display the mansion,
room by room, and do the duties of showman. The
excursion was a long one and would have been enough
to fatigue the strongest head, the gorgeous apartments
contained such a miscellaneous collection of pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
things. Padre Paoletti admired everything with much
politeness, showing that he was a man well versed in
collections and curiosities. Don Pedro, who talked
like the reporter to a newspaper and praised up the
mediocre and even inferior works, was apt to quote the
price of certain objects&mdash;pictures bought of Goupil, or
porcelains from some auction at the hotel Drouot,
most of them mere good imitations.</p>

<p>“I am overdone, positively overdone with fine
things,” said he, looking into Paoletti’s face and folding
his hands with an air of resignation. “I am the slave
of wealth, my good Padre. No one would think it,
but in fact it is the most intolerable form of slavery. I
really envy those who live at ease, with the freedom
and independence that poverty gives; without the anxieties
of business, with no banquet but what I could eat
out of a bowl and no mansion but some cell or hut or
cave!”</p>

<p>“But my dear Sir,” said the Italian, raising his
hand to his mouth to conceal a yawn, “nothing can be
easier than to realize such a wish. To be poor! When
I hear poor men sigh and wish they were millionaires, I
laugh and sigh; but when I hear a rich man pine for a
hovel and six feet of ground in which to rest his bones,
I say what I take the liberty of saying to you: Why
do you not retire among the hermits of Cordova?
Why not exchange Suertebella for a recluse’s cell?”</p>

<p>And he ended as he had begun, with a hearty
laugh; but he yawned again, screening it behind his
white hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is it&mdash;put in that way it sounds easy
enough,” said Fúcar, laughing too. “But&mdash;what of
social ties&mdash;of our duties to the State, who cannot
spare her most useful sons? But dear me, it strikes
me&mdash;how careless I am! It is so late, and you have
eaten nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh! never mind&mdash;do not trouble yourself.”</p>

<p>“Never mind! What next? Even your sainted
body must be fed.”</p>

<p>“On a little plain chocolate&mdash;nothing more. It is
a missionary’s body and can endure much.”</p>

<p>“Leon,” cried Don Pedro to his friend, whom he
spied passing across the next room, “I will order them
to serve breakfast in the Hall of Hymen. Then you
will be close to your wife: and you, Señor Paoletti,
will not care for the bustle of the dining-room; all the
party are breakfasting in there.... Bautista, Philidor!”</p>

<p>Hailing his Spanish servants and his French majordomo,
the marquis made the whole household stir in
the service of his guests. The multitude and zeal of
the domestics resulted in a general clatter; hasty steps
echoed over the inlaid floors, and on all sides the clinking
of bottles and glasses was heard on metal trays,
and the rattle of plates&mdash;welcome sounds to the hungry
but courteous visitor, while the fragrance of stewed
and fried meats pervaded the passages and rooms, as
incense floats from chapel to chapel in a church.</p>

<p>The Hall of Hymen, so called because, in the
middle of it, stood a group personifying marriage&mdash;two
figures clasped in each other’s arms holding two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
torches of which the marble flames burnt as one&mdash;was
quite close to the room which we may call María’s;
but it did not adjoin it. A table was laid at once, and
Leon and the priest sat down.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Consommé</i>,” said Leon pointing to a tureen full of
rich soup. “It will be very good for you,” and he
helped him to a large plateful.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” said Paoletti when, after a
few spoonfuls, he was recovering from the exhaustion
he had been suffering under for one hour past, “that in
the whole course of my life&mdash;not a short one, nor free
from strange conjuncture&mdash;I never have seen such a
picture as we two compose at this moment.”</p>

<p>“What picture?”</p>

<p>“Ourselves&mdash;you and I eating together. Nothing
is the outcome of chance; God alone knows what
divine purpose our strange meeting may be destined to
work out. What wonderful changes, even in the highest
destinies, have been wrought before now by the
meeting&mdash;apparently fortuitous&mdash;of two persons!
Reflect upon it, my dear Sir: sometimes a few minutes
thought, or some incidental remark may suffice to
throw a vivid light into the soul, and meanwhile.&mdash;No,
no, thanks; no highly flavoured dishes; none of
the delicacies of modern cooking.&mdash;Have you reflected...?”</p>

<p>“Will you have some wine?” asked Leon much
disinclined to follow the priest on the antipathetic
theme of his observations.</p>

<p>“No, I never drink it. A little water, if you please,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and God bless the giver. Any fool, seeing us sitting
opposite each other, would criticise you or me&mdash;:
‘Look at that wretched priest making up to a freethinker,’
they would say; or ‘Look at the infidel hob
and nob with the parson;’ not understanding that
though we are eating a little bread and meat together
truth can never come to a compromise with error, nor
error ever forgive truth, her bitterest foe,&mdash;Strawberries?
I never taste them&mdash;since truth puts error to
shame; hence she flies before truth, hiding herself
blindly in her own conceits, or filling her ears with the
tumult of the world.&mdash;But you are not eating!”</p>

<p>“I have no appetite.”</p>

<p>Paoletti had eaten but little; Leon hardly anything.
Fixing his expressive eyes on Leon’s face, the Italian
said with startling emphasis:</p>

<p>“Señor Don Leon, of all the world you seem to me
the most to be pitied. Our poor Doña María is not to
be pitied; no, only to be admired. If she dies she will
enter the realm of the blest wearing many crowns, and
among them the crown of martyrdom; if she lives
she will be an example to all women. She is a fair
lily, combining the graces of beauty, purity and fragrance.”</p>

<p>“Yes. She was, no doubt, such a lily,” said Leon,
turning very white, while his whole being quivered with
excitement.&mdash;“A lily which, in its purity and fragrance,
invited Christian love and promised all the honest joys
of life....”</p>

<p>“But it grew close by a thistle....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” interrupted Leon. “A hippopotamus came
and broke it down with its ruthless tread.”</p>

<p>The padre’s eyes grew bigger.</p>

<p>“She is a treasure of great price...” he said.</p>

<p>“She was a treasure of great price,” said Leon,
tying a knot in his napkin and drawing it very tight,
“but with coarse passions and a nature at once visionary
and sensual.”</p>

<p>“A purifying hand was extended to cleanse away
the dross...”</p>

<p>“A hand of ice&mdash;that snatched out the diamonds
and left false stones instead.”</p>

<p>“Why did the owner neglect his jewel?”</p>

<p>“When the thieves do not break in by the door, but
mine underground, the owner does not discover them
till they have stolen his gem.&mdash;They robbed her of her
love, generosity and trust, and left me nothing but cold
duty and moral proprieties. She was like a crystal fountain&mdash;they
dried up the spring, the water became stagnant,
and when I hoped to drink nothing remained but
filthy sediment. By constantly flowing, the water,
though somewhat bitter, would have grown sweet. But
they stopped the current and a foul swamp was the result.”</p>

<p>“Nay, the water is sweet and of wondrous power,”
said Paoletti with a seraphic look. “The mystic water,
freely bestowed; the very essence of the soul: Divine
Love. Where so precious a fount is found on earth it
is only just that God should absorb it, and break the
cup.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nay, the cup is just what has been left for me.”</p>

<p>“A golden cup; the only thing that can excite the
cupidity of a man devoid of faith. The miserable slave
of ‘Matter’ can never crave that precious drink; his
thirst cannot be allayed by spiritual love; it is only a
form of avarice and can be slaked by the possession of
the golden vessel&mdash;physical beauty.”</p>

<p>“For you who know nothing of love but through
sin&mdash;for you who never felt love but only hear of it, taking
in at your ears the secrets of others who love, to you
much of what concerns only the heart of man must be
an inexplicable mystery. You see nothing in life but
duties fulfilled and sins committed. This is much, no
doubt, but it is not all. Only the man who has never
drank at all can enjoy the insipid draught of mysticism,
or the bitter savour of sin.”</p>

<p>“Only the man who has never drank at all, and
who nevertheless is not thirsty, can, by the blessed gift
of intuition&mdash;which is one of the best graces of our
nature&mdash;fully enter into all the emotions of true love,
from the noblest to the basest. The man who knows
everything can feel for everything. You, who abuse us
so roundly, might have found friends in those whom
you have believed to be your enemies, and peacemakers
in your married life in those whom you regard as its
disturbers.”</p>

<p>“I refuse any such co-operation.”</p>

<p>“What right have you to complain when you have
yourself broken every tie? The mere circumstance
that he chooses to consider himself outside of the pale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the Church, deprives a man of the right of complaining
of the pressure of a bond which is in its nature a religious
one. ‘I need no religion,’ they say&mdash;‘I abominate
it, I cast it from me; but I do not allow religion to
defend itself against my attacks, I do not allow it to
claim its own!’”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;what I do not allow it to claim is mine.”</p>

<p>“God will have the divine part...”</p>

<p>“And I demand the human part...”</p>

<p>Neither of the men finished his sentence.</p>

<p>“The human part is a convenient loop-hole,” said
Paoletti sharply, “through which a man sneaks into
unfaithfulness and adultery, leaving the martyred wife
alone and without protection.”</p>

<p>“But the divine part puts the martyred wife under
the protection of those who drink of the spiritual
fount!”</p>

<p>“What would become of her if it were not so? the
wretched soul must become corrupt from contact with a
soul already corrupt.”</p>

<p>“I never tried to corrupt her: I tried to save her
by persuasion, almost always by kindness, sometimes by
authority verging on tyranny....”</p>

<p>“You confess it&mdash;you confess that you were despotic!”</p>

<p>“Not such despotism as it might have been in vulgar
hands. Some would have punished, I simply prohibited&mdash;and
my prohibitions were constantly disobeyed&mdash;I
could not have insisted without going to
cruel lengths.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the dove fled from the talons of the vulture,”
said Paoletti with a sort of honeyed sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Yes.&mdash;And fell into those of the vampire
who sucked all the sweetness out of my existence. I
was teaching my treasure to trust me and you taught
her to loathe me; I never argued against her beliefs, I
made no objection to her having a judicious confessor&mdash;but
her sanctimonious friends disgusted me. And my
enemy was not a man but a whole army&mdash;a host that
called itself celestial, and that has made itself formidable
by gaining allies in bigots and hysterical wretches
who believe themselves to be saints. I tried to fight in
the dark, but in the dark I was cut in pieces. An act
of hypocrisy such as has saved many a weak man,
would perhaps have saved me. She, poor deluded soul,
bound over to mysticism by promises of celestial joys,
proposed terms of peace; nothing could be easier&mdash;:
‘Abjure your mad scepticism; come into our fold,’ she
said. This was what they wanted! But I would not
purchase peace by an imposture, nor try to capture the
heart that was slipping away from me by false professions
of faith. I would not add another to the host of
hypocrites who make up the greater portion of modern
society.&mdash;Time went on; the struggle had to be
fought out. My sincerity exasperated my wife’s spiritual
advisers: the ministers of interference and of misapplied
piety.</p>

<p>“But after all, what does it matter? I would
rather be infamous in your eyes than in my
own.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>“A man who fears any eyes but those of God
should never speak of such things.”</p>

<p>“And if we are not allowed to talk, what are we allowed
to do? You pile a mountain on to a hapless
wretch and may he not groan when he is crushed?”</p>

<p>“Lift up your hands and hold off the rock that
weighs upon you.”</p>

<p>“I cannot, I cannot. It bears the burthen of centuries,
and is formed of the bones of a thousand generations!”</p>

<p>“Poor insect!” said Paoletti ironically. “I declare
nothing on earth moves me to pity so much as a philosopher.
For my own part I can only beg you to express
yourself with perfect frankness on all your feelings....”</p>

<p>“With frankness?”</p>

<p>“With perfect frankness, sparing me no hard
words.”</p>

<p>“When the storm overtakes me and lashes me and
fells me to the ground, what am I to think of that terrific
power? can I stop it, can I punish it, can I even
insult and abuse it? What can I say that will hurt it,
how can I defend myself against so formidable a foe&mdash;who
is but empty air?”</p>

<p>“Dear Sir,” said Paoletti folding his hands with an
expression of compunction: “I, as a humble but outraged
priest, pity you and forgive you.” And then his
slow, leaden step sounded across the floor as he made
his way back to the sick-room.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

ICES, HAM, CIGARS AND WINE.</h2>


<p class="mt3">The news of María’s improvement flew from room
to room, and down to the stable where Polito was lounging
about; to the hot-houses where Telleria and Onésimo
were inspecting the pines and making sapient observations
on the progress of acclimatisation&mdash;which,
according to Don Joaquin, must, in time, lead to a
vastly increased production of taxable material; to the
aviary where Milagros was lost in admiration at the
piping of the little birds, an amusement very much to
her taste; and was everywhere received with joy. A
number of visitors besides the Tellerias had come to
make enquiries, and each and all were met with the
same obsequious politeness on the part of the marquis.
Some only left a card and went away, but more intimate
friends staid awhile to condole with Milagros, who,
after making the tour of the garden, went indoors to
recover from her fatigues on a sofa in the Chinese
drawing-room. There, amid the bronze idols and
sombre porcelains, she breathed forth her complaints
and lamentations.</p>

<p>“That monster cannot make any objection now to
my seeing my daughter.... Here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>A footman, who was going through the room with a
tray of glasses and liqueur, paused at the call.</p>

<p>“Bring me an ice.”</p>

<p>“What flavour does the Señora prefer?”</p>

<p>“Pineapple if you have it or banana. Pilar will
you have some?”</p>

<p>“I have this instant been fed with some cocoanut
sweetmeat&mdash;plum-pudding&mdash;sherry, and I do not
know what more! That worthy stone-mason Marquis
tried to be revenged on me for all my jokes by stuffing
me to death. He insists that I am to dine here, to ride
in his carriages, use his horses and carry off all his
camellias. We know well enough that the worthy
broker has a good cook, good horses, a fine garden and
a tribe of bedizened servants.&mdash;The cook, I may say,
is not much to boast of, an apprentice from the Trois
frères Provenceaux&mdash;I declare this gingerbread palace
oppresses me more than I can say; it is for all the
world like a pawnbroker’s shop; or a livery coat figged
out with gold lace, or.... But, my dear Milagros, do
you know that we have an important part to play?
Shall we go into María’s room? Shall the reconciliation
be effected at once?”</p>

<p>The marquesa’s eyes opened wider like the revolving
light when it is growing broader; but they collapsed
again as she said:</p>

<p>“The reconciliation! Oh, that, unluckily, is not in
the programme.”</p>

<p>“And Pepa&mdash;where is she?”</p>

<p>“At Madrid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>“It would be an awkward thing if she were to come
to Suertebella. But I do not understand how María
came here.”</p>

<p>“My poor child was stricken down by a sudden
attack. She was in a house where there was no furniture&mdash;no
beds, nothing decent. Don Pedro had her
carried here. I am truly grateful to him for his kindness!
But that wretched son-in-law of mine&mdash;I cannot
help it, I must just tell you.&mdash;Ah! here is the ice.”</p>

<p>The lady had risen to her feet with some degree of
maternal and womanly dignity; but she suddenly
calmed down, and dropping into her seat again among
the monsters, she proceeded to eat the ice which soon
disappeared in the depths of her afflicted person.</p>

<p>Polito had come back to the billiard-room where he
was playing with his friend Perico Nules.</p>

<p>“Here, Philidor,” he suddenly exclaimed. “Just
be good enough to order some one to bring me a little
mild-cured ham, and a glass of....”</p>

<p>“Of sherry?” Polito hesitated, scratching his beard.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;you bother me. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chateau Yquem.</i> If I
could only do without this beastly tar; but I cannot, I
choke directly.... Stay, one moment <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon cher Philidor</i>,
some ham for this gentleman too, or some smoked
tongue and a glass of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pajarete</i>.”</p>

<p>When they were alone Polito lifted his fingers significantly
to his lips and said to his companion:
“Smoke?”</p>

<p>“Yes, let us smoke,” said the other taking his pipe
out of his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>“No man, not your own tobacco. There is a chest
full of cigars. All the produce of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Vuelta Abajo</i> is in
this house.”</p>

<p>The worthy couple, using their cues as walking-sticks,
made their way to a box which, by its insidious
fragrance betrayed the superior quality and aristocratic
brand of the cigars that lay packed within the cedar
boards.</p>

<p>“Very good tobacco&mdash;capital!”</p>

<p>“Look here my boy, all this comes, beyond a
doubt, from the wealth of the nation.... We may as
well lay in a stock.” And he plunged his hand into
the box.</p>

<p>“Come, this is going too far!” said Perico Nules
somewhat scandalized at the proceeding.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Let us sing like Raoul <i>chascun per se</i>,”
and he hummed the words to Meyerbeer’s air, the Marquis
de Fúcar’s store of cigars diminishing perceptibly
meanwhile.</p>

<p>“And, after all, what is all this that we see and
touch&mdash;and smoke?” said Nules, striking a match.
“What is the gorgeous and luxurious place where we
now are? this magnificent room, with its fine Arabian
tiles, the horses on which we were riding this afternoon,
the pines in the hot-house, the pictures, flowers, carpets,
vases.&mdash;What are they all? They are the juice, the
savour, the very extract of our beloved native land&mdash;you
understand? And as everything displaced by
foul means from its natural position tends, sooner or
later to return to it&mdash;just as animal organisms assimilate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
from nourishment the equivalent of what they lose
by wear and tear, the obvious consequence....”</p>

<p>Here the servant came in with the ham, and his
presence postponed the inference.</p>

<p>“And as we ourselves are the country, or an integral
part of it,” said Leopoldo.</p>

<p>“The country is claiming its own again,” added
Nules attacking the food.</p>

<p>This humorous youth was the originator, according
to trustworthy authority, of the ribald and malicious
interpretation of the pictures and texts in the chapel.</p>

<p>“Wealth, my dear boy,” he went on smacking his
lips over the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pajarete</i>, “works in a circle, you understand?
It returns to the point it started from.&mdash;The
State robs my father of half his income from Xeres in
the form of taxes; Fúcar, under the happy impetus of
a loan, robs the treasury of half a year’s revenue; and
I drink Fúcar’s wine and smoke his cigars, thus supplying
wants which my father fails to satisfy by reason of
the heavy taxation. You follow me in my explanation
of this circulation? But there are still a few cigars left
in the case; if we leave them, the servants will smoke
them.”</p>

<p>“Heaven forefend! <i>Pietoso ciel!</i>” sang Leopoldo.
“That would be too much! <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">In tal periglio estremo</i>,”
and again he hummed his Meyerbeer’s.</p>

<p>“Oh! what luck!” exclaimed Nules, looking out of
the window. “Here are the Villa-Bojío party&mdash;mamma
and two interesting daughters.” Leopoldo
peeped out to see the ladies stepping out of a landau at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the front door, and his heart stirred in his breast with
some little excitement&mdash;like the kernel of a “withered
nut rattling within its hollow shell,” as the wind sways
the bough on which it hangs.</p>

<p>“Let us take them out for a drive,” suggested
Nules.</p>

<p>“To be sure, what fun!&mdash;Philidor,” shouted Polito,
“let us have a carriage out.&mdash;But come and
meet them.”</p>

<p>“We will drive them out to Leganes.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to see there.”</p>

<p>“We can show them the lunatics.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />

A NOCTURNAL VISIT.</h2>


<p class="mt3">The improvement in the poor saint and martyr’s
condition continued all day; but in the evening she
was worse again. María had a headache and became
dull and melancholy. Paoletti had been with her most
of the afternoon, but had talked very little, and only
of unimportant trifles. Leon too, had been in her
room for some length of time, and more than once.</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” María said to him. “I do not know
whether my fancy is disturbed by fever, or whether it is
an illusion of the senses but I feel....”</p>

<p>“What do you feel?”</p>

<p>“As though somewhere&mdash;I do not know where,
there were a number of people walking about.... It
seems to me that I can hear a bustle of servants and
the rattling of crockery&mdash;I even smell the steam of
food which sickens me.”</p>

<p>Leon tried to coax her out of these notions but
could not succeed; she was not satisfied till Paoletti,
whom she trusted as the incarnation of truth, said:</p>

<p>“My dear daughter, this noise and these smells are
perhaps merely over-excitement....” This time the
cock did not crow.</p>

<p>“I must pray,” said María. “But do not go away
Leon, stay here. Seeing me so ill, I imagine you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
not laugh at me because I say my prayers. I want
you to hear me, and to be silent and listen&mdash;it is your
duty to do so. If you do not believe you can listen
and be silent. Do not go, do not leave the room....”</p>

<p>“I am here.”</p>

<p>“Sit down, and do not look at the floor, look at
me. Padre Paoletti and I will pray; and you&mdash;there,
close there&mdash;and keep quiet. Every word we utter
will be a lash&mdash;but keep quiet and do not move, look
at me&mdash;there, so; so that I can see you.”</p>

<p>And taking hold of his hand she looked tenderly in
his face.</p>

<p>“You ought not to try to pray,” said Leon. “Our
kind friend Señor Paoletti will pray&mdash;listen only, and
do not exhaust yourself.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said María taking a medal which Rafaela
had brought her from under her pillow. “Now,
to please me, kiss this medal.”</p>

<p>Leon kissed it, not once but again and again.
María did the same; then she murmured:</p>

<p>“Mother of God! save my atheist; and if he will
not be saved, save me, and so long as I live enable me
to be faithful.”</p>

<p>Quite unconsciously she had revealed her whole
nature in this brief supplication. The sum total of her
ideas was: “Let me be saved, even if to secure my
salvation I must trample underfoot the first law of married
life; while I neglect every human duty in order to
aspire and rise to ecstasy, let my husband, the man
whom the Church has bound to me, love me devotedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and passionately, and never even look at another
woman.” In a word: she wanted for herself, as being
in possession of the truth, the fullest liberty while he,
as the slave of error, was to bear all the burthen.</p>

<p>The room gradually grew darker&mdash;sank into funereal
gloom pierced only by the cadenced tones of the
priest as he repeated the prayers. It was strange, but
true; the voice which was exquisitely modulated in
conversation sounded rather harsh as he went through
the droning round of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paternosters</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ave Marias</i>.</p>

<p>Rafaela brought in a light just as the Padre ended,
and the sudden transition from the monotonous sound
to the lighter tones of conversation was like coming
out of a sepulchral vault into life and day. Paoletti,
after a few cheerful words to his saintly daughter, took
his leave, promising to return on the morrow. Leon,
bent on politeness, conducted him as far as the “Hall
of Hymen.”</p>

<p>“God grant,” said the priest with some acrimony,
“that her health may allow of my telling her the truth.
This farce is ceasing to be an act of charity!”</p>

<p>Leon watched the confessor as he carefully descended
the steps and got into a carriage, and as he
heard the wheels crunching the gravelled road across
the park he turned to go into the house.</p>

<p>“The truth&mdash;the truth!” he said to himself. “Yes,
let her know it and live! It is my sincerest wish.”</p>

<p>The rest of the party were spending a gay evening
in the tapestried drawing-room&mdash;so called because it
was hung with such works of art, in which the faded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
hues and ghastly faces seemed to represent a world of
consumptive victims. Leon had no desire to join them;
he went back to his wife. During the evening nothing
occurred worthy of mention, excepting that the doctor,
not yet quite satisfied as to the issue, insisted more
stringently than ever on complete rest, and put a positive
veto on prayers and religious excitement. It was
about ten o’clock when María, after a little calm sleep
became restless and eager to talk. Leon in obedience
to her wishes, had placed the sofa by the side of her
bed and was trying to get some repose. But María
began asking him a hundred questions about himself
and others, mixed up with the old familiar homilies, the
old impertinences that had so often annoyed him in
former days: He was called an atheist, a hardened
materialist, an enemy to God, a man of pride and sin&mdash;though
all this vituperation was accompanied and
sweetened by María’s pretty hand coaxingly stroking
the infidel’s beard, patting his cheek or pinching his
throat, so sharply indeed, now and then, that her
husband exclaimed: “Oh! you are hurting me!”</p>

<p>“You deserve worse than that.&mdash;But much will be
forgiven you if you only do your sacred duty by me.”</p>

<p>After this there was a long pause when both seemed
to be sleeping, but suddenly María awoke with a start
saying:</p>

<p>“Come now Leon&mdash;which of us is more worthy?”</p>

<p>“Why you of course; there cannot be a doubt of
that.”</p>

<p>“Help me to remember. Did I really tell you that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
I did not love you, and did you tell me that you did
not love me?”</p>

<p>Leon was puzzled and did not know what to say.</p>

<p>“I remember nothing of it,” he said at last.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? You do not remember? Did
I dream it?”</p>

<p>“I do not remember. I have made it my business
to cultivate oblivion.”</p>

<p>“But do not leave me.”</p>

<p>“I have not moved.”</p>

<p>“Come closer&mdash;so. How pale you are and your
eyes are hollow. Come quite close and lay your head
by mine.”</p>

<p>Then she fell asleep again, her hand still clutching
her husband’s hair, as painters represent an executioner
holding the head of a traitor up to public view.</p>

<p>The sickly, tremulous glimmer of the night-light, in
the porcelain shade with its opalescent and pearly transparency,
throwing a broad quavering circle on the ceiling,
gave light enough to cast ill-defined shadows of
their forms and faces. The sad twilight, suggesting that
which must prevail in Limbo, gave a doubtful solidity
to everything in the room, and soothed the senses to a
torpid state verging on stupor. Leon lay neither waking
nor sleeping; fatigue kept him from thorough wakefulness
and anxious thoughts prevented sleep. The
night was far advanced when he heard a slight noise in
the room, and looked up much startled, for it seemed
impossible that any one should come in at that hour.
His blood ran chill as he saw a form, a shape, a shade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
slowly coming towards him. It looked no more substantial
than an optical illusion caused by the mysterious
light in the china shade. Happily he had no belief
in ghosts. He wanted to examine the phantom, which
he immediately perceived to be a living human creature,
but he could not stir. María’s fingers held his hair, and
the slightest movement would have disturbed his wife
who was sleeping peacefully. He raised his arm to
gesticulate a warning as he could not express himself in
any other way, but the figure paid no heed; it came up
to the bed and leaned over it with evident curiosity, not
unmingled with fear. Leon could feel himself enveloped,
so to speak, in a gaze of melancholy pathos. His
heart throbbed as violently as a maniac struggling in a
strait waistcoat. He was furious&mdash;he dared not speak,
dared not move to exorcise this nightmare visitation;
he saw that the phantom&mdash;to give it this childish appellation&mdash;moved
its head as if in reproach, or disapprobation,
or despair. Then it fled hastily and incautiously,
making more noise than at its entrance, and
leaving a sort of chill on its passage, like that of a
sudden draught of air.</p>

<p>María woke with a start.</p>

<p>“Leon, Leon,” she cried, “I saw....”</p>

<p>“What? Do not talk wildly.”</p>

<p>“I saw&mdash;and I heard a noise like that of a silk
gown&mdash;some one running....”</p>

<p>“Compose yourself. No one has been in the
room.”</p>

<p>“But I saw it,” said María, covering her eyes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
her hands. “I thought a woman went out at that
door.”</p>

<p>“Go to sleep again, and do not see and hear things
that do not exist.”</p>

<p>“Was it Padre Paoletti?”</p>

<p>“How could it be my child? It is midnight.&mdash;He
will come to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I want him to explain it to me; no one can
explain it but he.”</p>

<p>She went to sleep again with her hands piously
folded, thus leaving her husband’s head free. Leon,
finding it impossible to sleep when his mind was in such
a turmoil, feeling sure too that he heard some movement
in the adjoining room, rose with the greatest
caution, and walking softly and slowly left the room.
As he went into the next room he heard the sound&mdash;impossible
to mistake for any other&mdash;of the swift
rustle of a silk dress. He followed it from room to
room, but the noise fled before him&mdash;like some
prowling creature that feels itself hunted and flies to
hide its prey in the darkness. At last, in a room called
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Incroyable</i>, the fugitive dropped exhausted into a
seat. There was no lamp or candle in the room, but
through a ventilator that opened above one of the doors
a broad beam of light fell from the lamp that burned
all night in the corner of one of the wide corridors.
This partial and somewhat romantic light, though insufficient
for reading, for looking at prints, or for examining
the china, was enough to recognise, or even to study a
face by, if need be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Pepa Fúcar, for it was she who was flying through
her father’s house like a soul in torment, sat huddled in
a chair with her face hidden in her clasped hands and
bent down almost to her knees. She moaned rather
than spoke:</p>

<p>“I know what you are going to say to me&mdash;I
know; do not speak to me.”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake!” murmured Leon standing in
front of her. “How imprudent!”</p>

<p>“I will not come again; I will not do it again. I
know I have no right&mdash;that it is my fate to be
wretched and forsaken&mdash;always forsaken. I have
nothing to complain of&mdash;I can demand no explanations&mdash;I
dare ask nothing. Even to love you is forbidden.”</p>

<p>Leon sat down by her side. She did not cease her
heart-broken rocking, nor take her hands down from
her face. But presently, drawing herself up as though
to give herself courage, and conquer her heart by
trampling it down&mdash;and she even stamped on the
floor with her feet&mdash;she wiped away her tears with her
trembling hands, for she was not collected enough to
take out her handkerchief&mdash;nay, as a matter of fact
she had lost it&mdash;and said with an effort:</p>

<p>“It is over&mdash;I am not wanted here&mdash;I feel so
much, and I have no rights&mdash;I am a disgraced
woman. Your wife might strike me and only be applauded
for it.... Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Leon pointed to the door, but he did not speak.</p>

<p>She looked at him with pathetic devotion, but suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
lifting her hand she laid it on his head and with
the strength of intense passion she grasped his hair and
pulled him down. He was forced to bend&mdash;lower,
lower; she held his head with both hands for an instant,
and then she hit it&mdash;as if it were a thing she
could break.</p>

<p>“It is my turn,” she said in a broken voice&mdash;“mine,
to&mdash;pull your hair!” Leon pulled himself up&mdash;half-angry,
half-forgiving.</p>

<p>“Go,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, “good-bye. I do not wish to
bring disgrace upon you. I will go at once. My
heart is bursting&mdash;it chokes me to cry and to run.
Do not follow me.”</p>

<p>She slipped a key into the lock of the museum
door, which opened from one corner of the room they
were in, and vanished in the darkness. Leon departed
by the way by which he had come, returning to his
post like a faithful soldier.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />

LATET ANGUIS.</h2>


<p class="mt3">In the course of that afternoon Don Pedro Fúcar
had invited Doña Pilar de San Salomó&mdash;whom we
have seen looking on at the interesting spectacle of her
friend swallowing an ice in the Chinese boudoir&mdash;to
go round the hot-houses with him, and cast a glance,
by the way, at the English horses he had just had sent
to him from a famous stable in London. The worthy
money-dealer, the “product of his century,” the noble
who derived his patent, not indeed from battles against
the Moors, but at any rate from contracts with good
Christians, was well aware of the small estimation in
which he was held by Pilar. Still, not content with
having the exchequer of both hemispheres at his feet,
he was very anxious to stand in the good graces of the
initiated, so he overwhelmed his guest with attentions
and civilities. Besides displaying with more than usual
zeal all the splendours of Suertebella, he presented to
her some of the treasures it contained: exotic flowers
in costly vases, rare fruits, and, to crown all, some
sacred relics from the altars in his chapel. With all his
habits of politeness the moneyed magnate could not
conceal that each gift cost him a greater pang than the
last, and at length so far forgot himself as to sigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
deeply, gazing at the ground, as though he might there
see written in mysterious characters&mdash;like the binomial
theorem on Newton’s tomb&mdash;the formula of a bargain
or a loan which might bring the very earth we dwell on
into the money safe of the Fúcars.</p>

<p>The lady, misinterpreting this disturbance of mind,
ascribed it to the day’s events, to Pepa’s painful and
compromising position, and the unexpected presence of
Leon Roch and his wife. Satisfied that she was on the
right scent, Pilar, as they returned to the house, expressed
her thanks for all her host’s attentions, and
added:</p>

<p>“And your kindness is all the more striking when I
reflect that you must just now be greatly troubled by
all these rumours.”</p>

<p>“And such rumours!” exclaimed Don Pedro with
tragic emphasis. “You cannot imagine!... You
may fancy what they must be to make this mountain
quake!” And he laid his hand on his breast to indicate
that even that rock had its hidden springs of sentiment.</p>

<p>At five o’clock Don Pedro took his leave, after
once more placing the house and all it contained at
the service of the Tellerias. He himself went to
Madrid to dine with his daughter, and was not to return
till the next morning. Still, if anything serious required
his presence he would come at any hour of the
night. Happily María was much better and would no
doubt recover. After greeting Gustavo, who had but
just arrived, having been delayed by his parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
duties and the responsibilities of his office, he left the
house.</p>

<p>Pilar also had intended starting for Madrid, but she
was detained by Gustavo who was very anxious to tell
her Heaven knows what; however, the lady listened
to him eagerly, and with the keenest enjoyment of
some stupendous piece of gossip of very doubtful taste,
but which gratified her curiosity and her malice. They
walked out together in the garden, Pilar exclaiming
from time to time with a peal of laughter:</p>

<p>“It is like a practical joke which at the same time
is a kick or a beating! It is one of those providential
dispensations which make the victim cry and every one
else laugh. But in this case there is no call for pity or
sympathy. Merciful Heaven! What a great man you
are and how unfailingly ready to help every one! Why,
you intercept the progress of evil by arranging things
as cleverly as a novel writer, giving us a surprise that is
positively alarming&mdash;but a surprise that compels us to
turn to you and cry out: ‘Lord have mercy! Give us
warning before you strike!’”</p>

<p>This profane sally was followed by another burst of
laughter; then she said saucily:</p>

<p>“I shall go there.”</p>

<p>“You!&mdash;what for?”</p>

<p>“I should like to see their faces,” said Pilar stuffing
her handkerchief into her mouth; and she wiped the
tip of her tongue as the tip of a weapon is polished
after being dipped in poison. “I will find some pretext.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>It was dusk by the time Pilar called for her carriage;
she ordered the coachman to drive her to the Fúcar’s
house in Madrid.</p>

<p>She went in. Don Pedro and his daughter were
just sitting down to dinner with Don Onésimo and
Doña Vera. Fúcar invited Pilar to join them, but she
excused herself, saying that she had only just time to
give them the good news of which she was the bearer.
She kissed Pepa, she gave her hand to Onésimo and
then began to pet Monina.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Don Pedro.</p>

<p>“That María is really almost well again. And it is
quite certain that a reconciliation would be effected&mdash;Milagros
herself told me so. I am so glad! I cannot
bear marriages that turn out badly.&mdash;My little Monina,
will you not give me a kiss?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Monina decidedly, turning away and
covering her face with her little hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, silly, cruel child!”</p>

<p>“I do not love you....”</p>

<p>Repulsed on this quarter Pilar turned to Pepa, and
glancing at her compassionately she said:</p>

<p>“Good-bye dear ... you know I feel deeply for all
your troubles.”</p>

<p>She rustled out on Don Pedro’s arm, whispering a
few words in his ear which had the effect of a pistol-shot.
As she parted from him at the carriage door,
the lady fired a parting shot.</p>

<p>“I wished to warn you, that you might be on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
guard. Resignation, Señor Marqués, Christian submission
is what is wanting.”</p>

<p>Pepa meanwhile, lost in painful meditation, did not
know what to think nor to what possible issue to look.
Her spirit was torn by dark presentiments and wild
conjectures. This news of a reconciliation had pierced
her soul like a three-edged blade.</p>

<p>The quartette sat gloomily enough through the
meal; to Pepa food was a nauseous mixture that she
simply could not swallow, and her father hardly eat
anything either. In the midst of her utter misery, Pepa,
who had noticed her father’s strange look of worry and
vexation since the day before, saw that this evening he
was almost beside himself. Don Joaquin too, the partner
of all the marquis’ secrets was irritable; what was
happening?</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Pepa to herself, seizing on a notion sad
enough in itself but at this moment a happy one for her;
“My father must have suffered some great reverse of
fortune; he is ruined perhaps, we shall be beggars.”</p>

<p>This idea, gloomy as it was, comforted her. Her
father’s melancholy, in that case, had nothing to do
with her personal griefs. What did she care for other
interests, for all the money, all the bonds, all the securities,
all the loans past, present or to come? That
evening, Pepa might have passed close to all the
stamped paper in the world piled up in a heap and set
fire to on all four sides at once, and she would not even
have cast a glance at the ruin.</p>

<p>After dinner, and when their friends had left them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Pepa and Don Pedro withdrew to the room where
Monina slept just as the little angel, despoiled of her
clothes, was being put into the rosy paradise of innocent
dreams. Don Pedro took his grandchild in his arms,
and kissing her with even more tenderness than usual,
said:</p>

<p>“Poor little dove! you shall never fall into the
clutches of that vulture!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter Papa?&mdash;What is the matter?”
exclaimed Pepa, adding her more urgent embrace to
the soft clasp of Monina’s arms round the marquis’
bull-neck.</p>

<p>“Nothing, my child. Nothing. Do not be uneasy,
do not let yourself be agitated; trust in me, and I will
put everything right.”</p>

<p>“But will not you explain to me?...”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Has anything gone wrong in your business?”</p>

<p>“No my pet, no,” said Fúcar repelling this conjecture
with some indignation as casting a reflection on his
dignity as a man of business.</p>

<p>“I have made ten millions clear by the last loan.
Divest your mind at once of such a dismal idea!”</p>

<p>“But then....”</p>

<p>“It is nothing; do not worry yourself. Sleep peacefully
and leave it to me to put everything right.”</p>

<p>“And you are going out?” said Pepa disconsolately,
as her father disengaged himself from the loving arms
that held him.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have something I must attend to this evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
The Minister of Finance expects me. This
miserable country does not find the last loan enough&mdash;it
wants another.”</p>

<p>“I am really most uneasy. What was it that Pilar
said to you?”</p>

<p>“To me? nothing,” said the marquis a little awkwardly.
“Nothing but what you heard.”</p>

<p>“She whispered something.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;at least I do not remember it. The reconciliation
of our friend Leon with poor María seems to
be a settled thing&mdash;that was all. I am glad, for it is
altogether wrong that two persons of the highest character&mdash;a
good husband and a good wife&mdash;should
quarrel about a Mass more or less. It is perfect insanity.&mdash;Good-bye
sweet-heart.”</p>

<p>“Reconciliation!” exclaimed Pepa with flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>The marquis, who did not happen to see her at this
instant, took a few steps towards the door.</p>

<p>“Let us be thankful that those who are good can
be brought together again,” he murmured as he left the
room. “But for the wicked there can be neither peace
nor pardon.&mdash;May God forgive him!”</p>

<p>Pepa was about to speak, but the words on her lips
were so tempestuous that she restrained herself. She
sat a long time without stirring. Then she grew restless,
walked up and down the room, called her maid,
gave some orders, contradicted them, scolded the nurse,
and wandered aimlessly about the house.</p>

<p>When Monina was fairly asleep Pepa locked herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
into her own room: beyond a doubt some mystery was
in the air, filling it with an electric tension that could
be felt though not seen. But every human soul
tormented by a crushing grief is disposed to imagine
that the unknown woes of others must be of a similar
character, and Pepa believed that her father’s uneasiness
must be in some way akin to her own sorrows, or
at any rate that their griefs had a common origin.
The magnitude of her own misery blinded her to every
other; she could not think that any living soul could
be troubled by another cause than this dreaded truce
between Leon and María which had been so abruptly
announced.</p>

<p>No arguments to prove that the source of our anguish
may be a lie have any effect in extracting the
sting; on the contrary, a syllogism is the worst forceps
in the world and when it is applied to extract only a
thorn it seems to increase the smart a hundred-fold.
Pepa, when she tried to convince herself that Pilar’s information
was a fiction, only tortured herself the more.
This reconciliation racked her as though a harrow were
being dragged over her bleeding heart.</p>

<p>It was growing late, and Don Pedro, she knew,
would not come till morning. His benevolence and
liberality maintained more than one house in Madrid
besides his own.</p>

<p>An idea had entered Pepa’s head, and she did not
hesitate to carry it out. She drove to Suertebella,
crept into the house through the museum and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Incroyable</i>
drawing-room, whence she made her way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
through the long suites of apartments to the room she
wanted to reach. As we have seen she realised her
project; with regard to its issue we can only beg the
reader to have patience and read on.</p>

AN EXCESS OF ZEAL.</h2>


<p class="mt3">Very early on the Wednesday morning Leon went
out to take a walk in the garden. When he went in
again, he sat down alone in the “Hall of Hymen,”
where he was presently joined by Gustavo. Telleria
had put on a face of stern severity and held his head
high with an assumption of forensic dignity, and a certain
ostentation and inflation of demeanour due apparently
to the glow kept up inside him by the combustion
of “laws human and divine;” so that he seemed ready
to burst, but for the relief afforded by the crater of his
mouth through which all this inflammatory ferment
found an issue, mingled with the lava of his indignation.
Leon saw at once that mischief was brewing.</p>

<p>“I have been anxiously awaiting daylight to have
an opportunity of talking to you,” said Gustavo in dry
tones that argued considerable annoyance.</p>

<p>“If you were so impatient,” replied Leon even
more drily, “you might have struck a light and we
could have talked at night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>“At night? No. I feared I might disturb you
in more agreeable society,” said the lawyer sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Then speak at once, and as briefly as you can.
Forget, for once, that you are an orator, and that you
spend your life among women who are never tired of
talking.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to disappoint you, but I must tell you
that I cannot be brief.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse,” said Leon with sullen bitterness.
“Since you must preach, begin by preaching
patience.”</p>

<p>“You have plenty for your own evil deeds,” replied
Gustavo hotly. “What I ought to preach to you now,
is submission, if you were capable of it.”</p>

<p>“Submission? Am I not listening to you?” said
Roch, who had reached a state of mind in which he
found it impossible to conceal his antipathy for the
whole family.</p>

<p>“Still you will need it&mdash;for your sceptical coolness,
which is simply the corruption of your dead soul, will
not stand you in stead when you hear what I have to
say to you. You know that I am opposed to duelling
as being contrary to all laws human and divine.”</p>

<p>“I defend the practice no more than you do; but I
could think even duelling a good thing if the laws
human and divine of which you speak are yours.”</p>

<p>“They are mine, and they are the only true ones.
I hate duelling as being absurd and sinful; still....”</p>

<p>“Still, under existing circumstances,” said the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
interrupting him, “you are willing to risk damnation for
the pleasure of killing me.”</p>

<p>“It will be no pleasure, <em>I</em> am a Christian.”</p>

<p>“Speak out,” said Leon growing angry. “What
are you driving at? Have you come to challenge me?
A duel is an absurdity which is very generally accepted;
a murder depending on luck and skill which occasionally
is irresistibly forced on us. I accept this challenge
to murder&mdash;whenever you please; today, to-morrow,
with the weapons you may select.”</p>

<p>“No, you have quite misunderstood me,” said Gustavo
turning the question like a lawyer who only wishes
to prolong a case. “I was saying that even though I
am no advocate of duelling this would be an occasion
when I might set aside my religious scruples and take
up a pistol or a sword....”</p>

<p>“Then do so.”</p>

<p>“No.&mdash;You have done evil enough to justify such
a man as I am in trampling on every moral prejudice,
on all laws human and divine, and trusting to a weapon
to execute justice. But....”</p>

<p>“But....” said Leon mimicking his brother-in-law’s
tone. “Speak, my dear fellow; speak and think
frankly, as I do when I say: ‘I hate you.’”</p>

<p>“Nay. My principles do not allow me to say, ‘I
hate you;’ but, ‘I pity you.’ Not, ‘I will kill you;’
but ‘God will kill you!’”</p>

<p>“Then do not speak in accordance with your principles;
adopt some others for the nonce&mdash;try mine.”</p>

<p>“If I did I should place myself in antagonism to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
all law, human and divine. But to conclude: a duel
is out of the question, because in this case every advantage
would be on my side. In the first place: I am
right and you are wrong; you are the criminal and I
the judge; and by all the laws of logic I am the conqueror
and you are the vanquished. In the second
place: I am skilled in the use of every kind of weapon,
having for the sake of my health kept myself in constant
practice by shooting at a mark and fencing;
while you, who have given your whole time to the
study of physics and geology, cannot handle either a
pistol or a sword. So that even on the ground of brute
force I must be the conqueror. In spite of all this,
much as it may surprise you....”</p>

<p>“You forgive me!” exclaimed Leon controlling his
rage to indulge his sarcasm. “Thanks&mdash;a thousand
thanks&mdash;with your elephant-load of ‘laws human and
divine.’”</p>

<p>“I do not forgive you,” said the other putting all
the dramatic emphasis he could command into his fine
deep voice. “In renouncing the advantages I have
over you I simply renounce the task of punishing you
with my own hand, and deliver you over to the arm of
God, which is already raised to strike you.”</p>

<p>“Again many thanks,” repeated Leon but his irony
was not unmixed with anger. “You are no doubt
God’s high sheriff. It is, I presume to your familiarity
with God, whose apostle you are, that you owe your
knowledge of his high purposes and your certainty of
divine justice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>“The purposes of Providence are seen in events, of
which the ordering is sometimes so clear that none but
an idiot can fail to see in them the threatening gesture
of that awful arm. I do not fancy myself an inspired
prophet. To foretell your punishment I only needed
to know a fact of which you are ignorant. That is
why I refuse to fight, that is why I leave your chastisement
in the Hands of One who will inflict it more
surely than I can. And that is why I say: ‘You will
die!’”</p>

<p>“Die!” exclaimed Leon who, though he scorned
his adversary, could not hear these words without a
shock.</p>

<p>“Yes, you. You will die of rage!”</p>

<p>“That I think likely enough,” said Leon, thinking
over the odious list of his wife’s family. “One may die
too of a surfeit of relations; and when a man whose
only object in life is domestic happiness, with its pure
and honourable joys, finds nothing but a chamber of
torture where he is martyred on the rack, it is
probable that he will writhe and grow weary of it.
There are poisonous herbs, and there are venomous
families.”</p>

<p>“You will die of sheer rage,” Gustavo went on with
brutal insistence. “I know it, I have seen it&mdash;I have
it in my own keeping&mdash;in a sealed packet in my desk,
of which every letter is a drop of the mortal poison
which will be the death of you.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand,” said Leon, his curiosity
roused at last. “What is it? A lawsuit? Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
think you can kill me with a lawsuit? You wretched
law-mongers spend your lives in poisoning the human
race, and you think that I shall swallow the bait of your
sophistry.&mdash;I do not want to know what horrible intrigue
you have been plotting against me.”</p>

<p>“I am plotting no intrigue&mdash;there is no intrigue in
the matter.&mdash;There is nothing but justice; and even of
that justice I am not the originator but the instrument.
Under other circumstances I should have done nothing
to abet it, but since your behaviour to my poor sister,
aggravated too by the disgraceful facts that have lately
come to my knowledge....”</p>

<p>“When?” asked Leon and his voice was like distant
thunder.</p>

<p>“You do not know?”</p>

<p>“No. What are these disgraceful facts?”</p>

<p>“And the hypocrite can ask!&mdash;Here.”</p>

<p>“Here!&mdash;what?”</p>

<p>“You try to ignore it, but your pale face betrays
your guilt, and under the pangs of awakened conscience
even the hardened mask of the sceptic must blush.
Quite lately I have seen you in all the naked hideousness
of your nature, and the depravity of your moral
sense. It is monstrous!”</p>

<p>“Explain yourself&mdash;or ...” and Leon’s hands
were clenched as though he longed to choke some
one.</p>

<p>“By all means. Is your connection with the mistress
of this house any secret, as well as your treacherous
betrayal of the most saintly, pure, and angelic woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
that God ever sent into this world? However, your
conduct up to this time, though a breach of every law,
human or divine, has not been grossly scandalous.
Though morally criminal, you have not yet fallen in the
scale of wickedness to the level where it is hard to distinguish
a man from a devil.”</p>

<p>“Pray describe to me that depth of vileness in which
I might be taken for one of your friends,” said Leon,
again lending his fury the guise of an acrid humour
which, like absinthe, embitters and intoxicates a man
while it makes him laugh.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask me to tell you things you full
well know? But, to be sure, there are reprobate
natures which like to have the mirror held up to them,
and revel in the hideousness of their own image, like
apes who gaze at their reflection in a puddle.”</p>

<p>“No more of this coarse rigmarole and sham rhetoric!
Speak plainly, state facts, call things by their
names; we want no special pleading and parliamentary
rhodomontade; I am sick of this endless parade of
words, and confusion of divine laws with human subterfuge.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,&mdash;then I will speak plainly. After reducing
my unfortunate sister to the state in which she now
lies, any man, however wicked, might respect her weakness,
if not her innocence. In every dying human creature
there is something of the angel. You have not respected
even that; while your saintly victim is lying on her
death-bed, soothed perhaps by your lies, and believing
you less base than you really are, you can meet your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
paramour in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Incroyable</i> room. Cheating one, and
making love to the other; killing one by inches, and
giving the other the affection due to your wife! Well,
I can understand this, Leon. I can understand falsehood
and guilty passion.&mdash;What I cannot understand,
because it seems to me baseness too utter for humanity;
is that both crimes should be committed under the same
roof. Two such deeds of infamy are too much at the
same time and place.”</p>

<p>Leon, before his accuser had ended his diatribe, had
broken out into a frank fit of scornful laughter which
seemed to have dissipated his indignation.</p>

<p>“Laugh&mdash;laugh away&mdash;I am not surprised at that.
I am well aware of the audacious cynicism which lies
hidden behind that mask of philosophical virtue. Your
whole moral nature is like an artificial plant, which it
is easy to strip of the flowers and leaves which have
given it a semblance of life. That is what your moral
theories are: artificial flowers; for natural flowers
which have perfume and colour cannot bloom in an
empty vessel, or grow from a soil of mathematical formulas
and barren science. And to think that I could
defend you against the accusations of my family! that
I could ever have believed in your honour! Good
Heavens! how could I be so deceived.”</p>

<p>“But are you perfectly certain that I did meet Pepa
while my wife was asleep?” asked Leon in a sarcastic
tone which conveyed his sovereign contempt. “Did
you see it? There are eyes that see falsehoods.”</p>

<p>“I saw it. I was sitting with my mother, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
whatever her faults may be as a woman, is a tender and
loving parent, and who could not tear herself away
from this house where her only daughter is suffering.
Not being able to see her, in consequence of your cruel
and selfish prohibition, she resigned herself to weep
and watch from a distance the door of María’s room.
I sat with her all night, to share her grief, while my
father&mdash;whose weakness in the most critical circumstances
is really inexcusable&mdash;took a lamp and went to
inspect a collection of curiosities to which only men are
admitted by special permission from Fúcar. Polito had
drunk too much, with his friend Perico Nules, and was
rather noisy. He began by wandering about the passages
and annoying the maid servants, till I went after
him, and succeeded in locking him up,&mdash;by midnight
he was sleeping like a drunken angel. My mother and
I were making up accounts in the Chinese boudoir and
trying to arrange our disordered affairs; afterwards she
said her prayers, and I, after searching the house in
vain for a book to read, also gave myself up to my devotions.
Within these magnificent walls, where so
many marvels are collected, where copies from the
antique alternate with monstrosities of gaudy taste,
representative of modern art, there is everything that
man can ask for, excepting a library. Since, on entering
this house one must leave one’s intelligence on the
doorstep, it is as well perhaps that one’s senses should
be kept alive to make it easier!&mdash;My mother was tired
of praying but was not sleepy; she was thinking of our
dear María and of some way of cheating you and seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
her daughter. She would not go to bed and treading on
tiptoe, she took to wandering through the rooms.
As she approached the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Incroyable</i> room she thought
she heard voices. She called me, and I hastened to
join her; we went forward together and listened. The
first sounds we heard were sobs, as we thought,
but we at once understood that they were in fact passionate
kisses. It was you&mdash;and she.&mdash;We hid behind
the group of Meleager and Atalanta in the corridor
and heard her open the door into the museum; we
afterwards heard you pass through the room, returning
to hide your disgraced head, crowned, as I may say,
with laurels of infamy, on the pillow of your martyred
wife. The woman who was with you was Pepa; and
to remove every doubt my father can confirm it, for he
met her as he was returning with the lamp in his hand
from the cabinet of curiosities he had been inspecting.”</p>

<p>“And is that all?” said Leon calmly. “Has your
espionage discovered no more than that? There are
creatures who cannot breathe without exhaling slander!”</p>

<p>“Slander! What next? Of course I know that
you can give the facts an interpretation favourable to
yourself. You are never at a loss for sophistries to defend
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I, defend myself! I, condescend to touch the
dirt-heap of your foul suspicions, to argue about a fact
that you and your mother have seen through the jaundiced
spectrum of your impure imaginations!&mdash;Never!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>“The device is an ingenious one, but it fails of its
effect. I am not convinced.”</p>

<p>“I do not want to convince either you or her,” said
Leon with vehement fury. “Your opinion is to me so
absolutely worthless that I positively feel a certain satisfaction
in leaving you in your mistake. Your infernal
nimbus of evil thoughts becomes you so amazingly.
Do you think that I flatter myself that I can change
the baseness of your souls, or by any waste of words
create an idea of purity and honour in a mind tainted
with the leprosy of chronic sin? Your opinions, and the
opinions of all your execrable family, who repay solid
benefits with slander, are to me no more than the rain
which wets us but cannot blacken us. Do we quarrel
with the coach-wheel which splashes us with mud?
And you&mdash;the political and religious moralist, always
preaching party-sermons; you&mdash;a machine for grinding
out ready-made morality; you&mdash;who pound up
‘laws human and divine’ into a patent lozenge, to
cram the world with an anodyne of sophistry and piety
flavoured to each man’s taste&mdash;you cannot dose me
with morality packed into a sugar-plum! My faults
may perhaps serve your turn as virtues, and the base
sentiments that I disown and cast out, you may, if
you please, pick out of the dirt and make the pride and
boast of your conscience. Before preaching to me why
do you not look at home? If you study yourself you
must surely see that your life, your fame, and your
credit would vanish like smoke if San Salomó were a
man instead of a puppet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Gustavo’s lips were bloodless, his hands trembled
and his eyes flashed as Leon spoke; and then, not
knowing what to say, he hesitated a few minutes before
he spoke.</p>

<p>“You are a skilful antagonist,” he said, “and have
turned the point against my own breast. Well&mdash;I do
not deny it; you may learn from me at any rate the
virtue of candour, the merits of confession, of which an
atheist is incapable. I plead guilty; the giddy whirl
of the world, the weakness of Man’s nature, the blandishments
of flattery and applause have led me, I own,
into antagonism to those laws, human and divine,
which I acknowledge and respect. I am the first to
accuse myself, as I was the first to cast a stone at the
scandals of my family, and the first to defend you so
long as I believed in your integrity&mdash;you know that.
But there is no sort of comparison between your crime
and mine, between your treachery and mine. We
have both sinned; you, out of sheer cynicism and absolute
ignoring of right, I out of weakness of will. In
you there is nothing but evil, there is no door by which
good can enter into your darkened soul; in me,
though my deeds have been evil, faith is still left&mdash;a
way by which good may come in. Your sin stands
alone in its hideous blackness; mine has brought with
it the precious grace of repentance. You are not capable
of any amendment; I am. You see nothing
beyond; I see salvation, because I see amendment.
To me, the very idea of sin suggests that of pardon. I
do not know my own destiny, but I do know that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the human race, and the fact that Heaven exists is
enough for me. You know nothing, and evil has no
terrors for you because you do not believe in the existence
of Hell.”</p>

<p>“This is sophistry, and mere juggling with words.
What can you know of what I think or am? Do you
believe that men and souls are at the mercy of your
apostolic dogmatism, of your insolent and official interpretation
of the gospel by which you issue death-warrants
or reprieves? You fancy yourself a sort of inspector
of passports to Heaven! But do you suppose
that there really is an office where our luggage is examined
to see if we are smuggling tobacco&mdash;that is to
say anything prohibited in your manufactories of lies
where ideas are stamped and then sold, all cut and
dried, to hypocrites?&mdash;Do me the favour and honour
of relieving me of your presence or I cannot answer for
observing the respect due to this house and to the tie
which unites us.”</p>

<p>“You are the murderer of an angel!” bellowed Gustavo,
mad with fury.</p>

<p>“I shall really lose patience with your follies,” said
Leon, taking three steps forward with so threatening a
gesture that Gustavo involuntarily retreated, but he was
no coward and at once made a stand. “Be silent or
you will find out that my endurance has an end and
see what a man can do when he can bear no more.”
And pointing to the window Leon extended an arm
which, though by no means Herculean, was capable of
exerting no small strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>“And if you continue to provoke me, although I
am no advocate of duelling, and have no practice with
pistols or swords, and no skill in preaching sermons, I
will promise you a pleasant half-hour. I will show you
how an apostle flies out of window and no earthly
power can prevent it.”</p>

<p>“Indulge if you choose in such an abuse of brute
strength!” retorted Gustavo with a glare of defiance.
“You have murdered my sister as it is.”</p>

<p>“You cannot aggravate my rage by saying that,”
cried Leon beside himself. “Your sister and yourself,
your father and your mother, are to me no more than
the birds that fly past. You have ceased to exist for
me.&mdash;Now choose&mdash;the door or the window.”</p>

<p>The dispute might have terminated in a fray and
perhaps some act of violence, but the marquesa came
rushing in with loud cries, and behind her Don Agustin
in evident dismay and alarm.</p>

<p>“What is all this? Leon&mdash;Gustavo&mdash;my dear
children!” cried the lady, interposing with outstretched
arms.</p>

<p>“This man,” roared Gustavo.</p>

<p>“Leon&mdash;what will you do next? After shutting
up our darling so cruelly....”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;shut her up! I?” said Leon talking rather
wildly. “No, there she is; I leave her to you, I make
you a present of her.”</p>

<p>“You would not allow us to go in to see her.
Thinking of that sweet martyr, I have not slept a wink
all night,” said the marquis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go in, all of you,” said Leon pointing to the door
leading to his wife’s room. “Go in.”</p>

<p>And without waiting for another word, the Tellerias
rushed in. A vehement sound of kissing ensued, given
with a warmth and eagerness that were only natural
after this enforced separation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"> </div>


<h2 id="CHAP_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />

THE TRUTH.</h2>


<p class="mt3">After the first greetings were over María asked:</p>

<p>“Tell me, Mamma, did I dream it, or is it true that
I heard Gustavo’s voice and my husband’s as if they
were quarrelling?”</p>

<p>“We had a little discussion,” said the young man,
who had not yet recovered from his pallor and nervousness,
nor got rid of the lines in his forehead&mdash;that
sacred tablet on which fancy might read the decalogue
and the latest code.</p>

<p>“No, no, mere words and rubbish,” interrupted
Milagros, whose one idea was the reconciliation, a
thought intimately allied with the wish.</p>

<p>“Your respected husband, made madly savage by
my accusations, proposed to settle my share in the business
by flinging me over the balcony like a cigar-end,”
said Gustavo, and he tried to laugh at his own wit in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the belief that the effort would restore his nerves to
their normal balance.</p>

<p>“Where was this?”</p>

<p>“In the ‘hall of Hymen.’”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry yourself about it, my darling child.”</p>

<p>“My dearest daughter,” said her father, caressing
her, “you must learn to accustom yourself to view your
husband’s proceedings with indifference, and to feel that
what he does, or leaves undone cannot matter to you.
It is greatly to be regretted that you cannot get over
certain deeply-rooted feelings, and that you are bent on
being a martyr and struggling against wind and tide.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about, Papa?” asked María
bewildered.</p>

<p>“I,” continued Don Agustin, laying his hand on his
burly person to attest his honour, “I am determined to
bring all the energy of my character to bear on the one
object of avoiding a scandal which must bring discredit
on us all, and place you in the most ridiculous position.”</p>

<p>“Agustin,” said Milagros, unable to conceal her
vexation, “you had better go and study the museum.
You are not wanted here.” And she gave emphasis to
the hint by nudging her husband’s elbow to convey to
him that the time had not come for any display of
energy or avoidance of scandal. As a woman and a
mother she had understood the illusion in which Leon
had chosen to leave his wife, and approving it, endeavoured
to keep it up.</p>

<p>“What museum?” asked María more and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
puzzled, and seizing at once on any clue that might
strengthen her awakened suspicions.</p>

<p>“A museum not far off,” stammered the marquis
taking his wife’s hint and acting upon it to the best of
his intelligence, for with all his faults he was devoted to
his daughter. “One that has lately been opened at
Suertebella....”</p>

<p>María looked from one to another in blank astonishment,
questioning them with dull bewilderment in
her eyes, while her lips could hardly frame the enquiries
that formed themselves in her brain.</p>

<p>“Suertebella&mdash;near this?” she murmured. “Tell
me one thing.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“What is it, my child?”</p>

<p>“How is it that I seem to feel the stone and mortar
of that house here&mdash;in my very being; I feel its
walls....”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about my love?”</p>

<p>“Its walls are crushing me.”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens! do not talk so wildly!”</p>

<p>“What delirious fancies are these! It is much to
be regretted that your sound judgment....”</p>

<p>“This house....”</p>

<p>“Is a house ... you know, a building....”</p>

<p>At this instant Polito flew into the room with outspread
arms and flung them round his sister exclaiming:
“Mariquilla, so at last your blessed husband will allow
us to see you! He is a gaoler, a bandit, a wretch! I
was in the court-yard looking on at a fight between two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
dogs and fourteen rats when they told me I might see
you. I rushed up.&mdash;And your husband is out there
too, looking like a statue, and more stony than the
group of Hymen. Dear little woman, you are quite
well now, are you not?&mdash;you will get up and get away
from this place?”</p>

<p>Milagros almost skinned her elbow driving it against
her son’s ribs, but without putting a check on this
torrent of indiscretion.</p>

<p>“There is a strange and horrible look of fear on all
your faces,” said María, gazing at them all in turn.
“You look as if you longed to tell me, but at the same
time wanted to hide some dreadful fact.”</p>

<p>“My darling child, you are still far from strong,”
said the marquis stroking her hair. “When you are
quite well again and can come home with us....”</p>

<p>“The poor child fancies things that have no existence,”
said Milagros anxiously. “It would be far
better if you would all go and leave us to ourselves.”</p>

<p>“You are deceiving me, you are in league to deceive
me!” cried María with sudden frenzy. And raising
the Crucifix that lay upon her pillow, she said:</p>

<p>“Dare to tell a falsehood in the face of this.”</p>

<p>They all were silent except Gustavo, and he, extending
an oratorical and legislative hand towards the
sacred image, said, with grandiloquent emphasis:</p>

<p>“I abhor falsehood, and I believe that it can never
under any circumstances be wrong or injurious to speak
the truth.”</p>

<p>Milagros seized him as if to thrust him out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
room; but he went closer to his sister and, patting her
cheeks, bent over her to say:</p>

<p>“But you are worrying yourself about trifles.
Your saintliness and virtue have given you a position
so exalted that you can afford to look down with contempt
on a man who deserves nothing else from you.
You are better already, and before long we will take
you home, to our house, where you will be better cared
for than ever, where we shall appreciate your worth and
adore you as you deserve to be adored.... Rejoice
instead of sorrowing, and give thanks for your recovered
freedom. Poor martyr!”</p>

<p>Gustavo did not mean to be perverse, but he was
possessed with a perfectly fanatical form of what is
called public virtue.</p>

<p>“Poor martyr.” María repeated sadly, fixing her
eyes on vacancy, on a remote spot where there was absolutely
nothing to be seen, nothing but the vague projection
of her own thought. After a short silence she
said in a voice that became weaker as she spoke:</p>

<p>“I dreamed it. I dreamed the truth, and falsehood
cheated me when I awoke.”</p>

<p>Then, suddenly sitting up in bed, she cried out:
“Where is my husband?”</p>

<p>“He will come this moment, my sweet,” said her
mother kissing her fondly. “Compose yourself, or you
will make yourself ill again.”</p>

<p>“Who was it but you that filled my mind with jealousy?”
the martyr went on, turning indignantly on her
mother. “Why should you try to soothe me now?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Fetch my husband and Padre Paoletti.&mdash;Every one
else must go; leave me with them.”</p>

<p>She put her hand to her forehead with a sharp cry.</p>

<p>“What is it? Merciful Heaven!”</p>

<p>“A pain in my head,” she murmured closing her
eyes. “A pain that pierces and burns my brain.&mdash;That
woman! Mamma, do you see her? That woman
has driven a red hot nail into my head.”</p>

<p>They all stood dumb with horror.</p>

<p>“Help me, help me!” cried María fairly raving.
“Do you not see her coming towards me? Will no one
have the charity to drive her away, to throttle her?
Jesus, Saviour of my soul&mdash;protect me!”</p>

<p>There was a solemn and terrified silence, broken
only by the marquis, who indulged in a smothered fit
of coughing. Milagros was crying, kissing her daughter,
and appealing to her with tender words. But
María did not answer; her eyes were shut and her
speechless stupor was like the silence of death.</p>

<p>They were rushing for the doctor when he came in.
He immediately pronounced the patient to be in a very
critical state; he was excessively angry, saying that he
would take no responsibility, as his orders had not been
obeyed, and ordered every one out of the room with
exasperated indignation.</p>

<p>Heroic remedies could alone avail. The battle
which had seemed to be won, would yet be lost but by
the grace of God. His utmost powers must be put
forth to make up for this sudden desertion on the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
of Nature; she had gone over to the enemy’s camp,
leaving science single-handed and almost desperate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After his dispute with his brother-in-law, Leon had
remained quiet for a little while; then he was seized
with that craving for violent exercise which comes over
us in certain states of mind, as though a skein of suffering
were wound round us and we must walk far to release
ourself.</p>

<p>For above an hour he paced about the grounds.
When he came in again, as he was passing through the
“Hall of Hymen,” he perceived, on a chair, a broad
brimmed black hat. Seated on the divan which surrounded
the pedestal of the marble group, he discovered
the diminutive person of Padre Paoletti, looking smaller
than ever in his hunched-up attitude. Out of the little
black mass came his pleasant face and those eyes which
sparkled so vividly, as he slowly uncurled himself like a
snail creeping out of its shell. It was a strange fact,
but in his present state of mind the presence of the
priest seemed to comfort Leon.</p>

<p>“They told me as I came in,” said Paoletti in evident
distress, “that Doña María was suddenly very
much worse. You see how useless our deceit has been.
Is the time come for the truth?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Leon holding the door for Paoletti
to go into the room first.</p>

<p>They arrived just as Moreno was applying the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
resources of his skill. Paoletti at once retired to pray
in the chapel, which was ablaze with tapers; the husband
and the physician remained to watch with infinite
anguish and pity the drama of a diseased brain where
ideas&mdash;or intangible fluids&mdash;and organic life&mdash;or a
mysterious essence&mdash;were going the circuit of the nervous
centres in a bewildering round, their obscure
struggle hastening on the divorce which we call death.
Everything was done that lay in human power to avert
immediate danger and divert the mischief from the
centre to the extremities. But no remedy availed to
rouse the reaction that might have expelled the enemy.
It progressed triumphantly, like a desperate invader
who has burnt his ships. They tried everything and
each trial only confirmed them in despair.</p>

<p>All day the sufferer lay in a state of alternate delirium
and prostration. The physician announced with
solemn decision that the end could not be far off.</p>

<p>“What remains to be done,” he said, “is in the
hands of the physician of the soul.”</p>

<p>Later in the day María seemed to wake up and her
mind was clear; she was quite herself again, and enjoying
that brief interval of lucidity which nature almost
always grants in such cases, as though to allow those
who are about to pass into the other world to cast a
parting glance on this which they are quitting.</p>

<p>“Pray leave me alone with my spiritual director,”
said María in feeble accents, and the husband and doctor
at once left the room. There was no further need
for science or earthly love.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

THE BATTLE.</h2>


<p class="mt3">María fixed her eyes on Paoletti’s face with a softened
gaze. The circumstances were so solemn that
even the good little priest, accustomed as he was to
melancholy and emotional scenes, was deeply moved.
Controlling himself however, he went up to the bed, and
taking the fevered white hand that she held out to him,
said with mystical enthusiasm:</p>

<p>“We are alone, my beloved daughter&mdash;my sister
and friend, whom I love most truly; alone with our
spiritual thoughts and sacred fervour. Fear has no place
here; joy reigns alone. Arise, pure conscience, fear not;
appear in all your brightness, rejoice in your own
beauty, and instead of dreading the hour of release look
forward to it eagerly. Oh Triumph! do not disguise
thyself under a false semblance of defeat.”</p>

<p>María, less eager than usual to swallow the sweet
droppings of this mystical honeycomb, was thinking, in
fact, of something else. It was with bitterness as well
as sadness that she said:</p>

<p>“I have been deceived.”</p>

<p>“With a pious purpose,” replied Paoletti promptly.
“The alarming state of your health required the concealment
of the painful truth. Forgive me if I too lent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
myself to the deception which was, as I repeat, a deed of
Christian charity. I saw how necessary it was to second
your husband’s beneficent plan....”</p>

<p>“And he has kept me, and is keeping me, under
that woman’s roof,” she exclaimed, half-choking.</p>

<p>“It was through no fault of his. There was no
other house within reach where you could have the
requisite medical attendance and be properly taken care
of. I entirely approve of your having been brought
here. A life in imminent peril is not a thing to be lifted
and carried about like a sack. The best thing that could
happen to you was to be here.”</p>

<p>“And I dreamed it&mdash;and when I woke they denied
it.” She was too weak to speak more than a few words
at a time, and it is impossible to give any idea of the
feeble, extinct, quavering tones of her voice. It was
like that of a forsaken child, wearied out with calling
and crying for its mother.</p>

<p>“And my husband and that woman,” she went on,
“will meet hour after hour in this house to embrace and
to count ...” again her voice failed her, and Paoletti
himself felt a lump rising in his throat.</p>

<p>“To count the minutes I have left to live&mdash;as I
count the beads of my rosary.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which the confessor tried
to regain his composure.</p>

<p>“My dearest friend in the Lord,” he began, “this is
really a monstrous invention of your fancy. Listen to
me while I tell you the exact facts, the truth to which I
bear witness as a servant of God. The truth can do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
no harm to a noble soul like yours; a conscience so
brave and so blameless will not be unhinged by a
revelation of human weakness which cannot in any
way affect it, any more than the dust blown up from
the highway can affect the purity and whiteness of the
clouds in the sky. You shall hear the whole truth, with
nothing kept back and nothing added. Don Leon, it
is true, loves this lady; he himself owned as much to
me; and as he did not tell me under the seal of confession,
I may and ought to tell you. But at the same
time, I solemnly declare to you that the lady is not
now at Suertebella, but that your husband himself begged
and desired her to leave. Decency I may say required
it, which is the outward sign of the grace of
modesty. Your unhappy husband is, of course, incapable
of any moral feeling; but, thanks to a cultivated
mind, he has the religion of appearances, and can always
assume that superficial guise of virtue which we
term chivalry.”</p>

<p>María made no reply. Her white hand, which had
not, during her brief illness, had time to grow thin and
retained its delicate roundness, was playing with the
fringe of the counterpane. Not far from this restless
hand was the small bullet-head of the Italian; his face
pale and lifeless when he sat with his eyes cast down,
though, when he looked up, they glittered with a flash
that suggested the sparkling of fireworks.</p>

<p>“I cannot believe,” said the priest fixing María with
the fascination of that glance, “that a spirit so fortified
by divine love as yours is, can allow these facts to disturb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
it. I know you well, and I cannot imagine that
beautiful soul fettered and dragged down by trivial anxieties
like any ordinary woman, or detaching its thoughts
from the sublime ideal spheres to wander through the
murky paths of worldly disputations, like idle minds
that find time too long. Am I right my beloved
daughter? Am I mistaken in thinking that those eyes,
accustomed to the splendours of Heaven, can no
longer deign to look down on the feebler lights of
earth?”</p>

<p>“I am jealous,” said María the tone in which we
state a pathetic truth. And just as the centurion gave
the Redeemer a sponge dipped in vinegar for refreshment
when he was athirst, the priest poured honey and
vinegar into María’s parched soul.</p>

<p>“Jealous!” he said. “Jealous, when you have fired
your heart with the love that is never unrequited! Unless
I have failed to enter into the feelings of my illustrious
penitent, she must have fortitude, and grace, and
a sense of divine love which will raise her above such
base anxieties. Jealous&mdash;of whom? Of another
woman, and for the sake of a man; jealous, of nothing
in a creature who is nothing and who is worth nothing!&mdash;Some
radical change must have taken place in your
mind, my dear daughter. What has occasioned it?”</p>

<p>“Jealousy,” murmured María from the depths of
her anguish.</p>

<p>Then, by slow degrees, frequently pausing to rest,
María related all that had happened since Pilar de San
Salomó had told her of Leon’s infidelities, until she lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
consciousness. She told the priest everything, omitting
nothing of importance, nor any interesting detail.</p>

<p>“Excepting your outbursts of indignation, your
sacrifice to worldly prejudice in the matter of dress,
and your overhasty action, there is nothing reprehensible
in your conduct,” said Paoletti as he sat with his
head resting on his hand and his eyes cast down on the
floor&mdash;like a weapon laid by in its sheath, listening to
her story, word by word, drop by drop like an extract
distilled from an alembic. María breathed a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>“I thought I had sinned heavily,” she said.</p>

<p>“You have sinned no doubt, in the way I have said;
but it is no mortal sin. I see in your visit nothing more
than a woman’s natural impulse to prevent the rupture of
a sacred tie. I have told you already, many times, that
your pure desire to cultivate the spiritual life, and his
deep contempt for the faith cannot exempt either of
you from the duties of married life. So long as you
both live, you are bound together by the sacrament of
marriage, and when one strove to burst the bonds it was
only natural and right that the other should fly to prevent
it; nay to tighten the tie if that were possible.
Ah! my most precious daughter, how often have we
talked it over!”</p>

<p>María nodded affirmatively and fixed her eyes on
the ceiling.</p>

<p>“When my object was to give a fixed purpose to
your beautiful life, I have often said this,” continued
Paoletti, not lifting his gaze from the ground, but staring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
at the carpet, as if he did not know where to look.
“Many times as you know, I have quieted your mind
on this point when you were disturbed by scruples.
‘No,’ I have said, ‘God cannot require a married
woman to close her mind to every consideration of
what she owes to her husband.’ He, even though he
may have erred in spiritual things, has a right which
cannot be abrogated even though his ideas and principles
may be in direct opposition to those of his wife.
Although, seeing his contumacious incredulity it is impossible
that you should give him an atom&mdash;I say an
atom since I must perforce use a material image&mdash;an
atom, I say, of your exquisite spirit, of those graces
which are claimed by their Creator; although you cannot
have any single idea in common, nor that confidence
which might fill him with vain hopes that he could ever
turn his wife out of the path of perfection in which she
is walking&mdash;still, all that is not of the spirit is his; all
that is essentially of the flesh and world. You have
confided to me all your most intimate thoughts, all the
tender secrets of your soul&mdash;all your husband’s expressions
and opinions; I have fully appreciated him
and on my knowledge of the facts I laid down for you
a scheme of life to which you have perfectly conformed
until now, when I find you distraught and wandering
from the path. But remember all we have said about
it, and my arguments which will set everything in its
right light; and never confuse spiritual things with
what is merely human, or that which is of God with
the things of the flesh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>María said nothing, but turned herself wearily on
her pillow.</p>

<p>“Speak to me, my dear and precious lamb.”</p>

<p>“My husband said a great deal....” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Yes; and you know that in our delightful discussions
I was always able to confute his sophistical arguments;
you always saw I was right&mdash;you were always
convinced.”</p>

<p>“But then I was not jealous&mdash;and jealousy&mdash;I
know it now as surely as I know God&mdash;jealousy is my
way of loving.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you loved him!” said Paoletti a good deal
confused, as he glanced up for a moment and then
looked down again, “because you took an interest in
him, and did not wish him to suffer; and in this I supported
you&mdash;always supported you.”</p>

<p>“But still, he said a great deal,” repeated María in
the same weary tone of an unhappy child. “He said
that you....”</p>

<p>“Well, that I?”</p>

<p>“That you, by constantly pruning my affections to
concentrate them on God, by pruning my ideas, from a
terror of atheism, by robbing him of my heart and
leaving nothing but duty, had left him nothing of his
wife but the slave of his desires.”</p>

<p>“Oh! woman, woman!” exclaimed Paoletti eagerly
and not without some dignity. “How often have I refuted
this argument, which is terrible only in appearance,
and left you soothed and reassured!”</p>

<p>“But can you refute the fact....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>“What fact?”</p>

<p>“That I am jealous, envious; that now I long for
what is no longer mine.”</p>

<p>The worthy priest looked up and raised his head:
nay, not content with this, but wishing, it would seem,
to let the light of his eyes shine forth like a beacon to
guide the wandering seaman, he rose to his feet and
stood looking down on his penitent. He was in fact
uncomfortable, ill at ease, and, if the truth must be
told, not entirely pleased with himself.</p>

<p>“My dear lady,” he went on, piercing her with his
glance as an angel might pierce with his sword, “I
shall be compelled to speak to you with a severity
which ill accords with the friendship&mdash;Friendship, do
I say?&mdash;respect, veneration, which I feel for you; for
indeed your many and great perfections have made me
cease to regard you as a penitent or even as a friend in
the Lord; I have learnt to think of you as a saint, as a
pure and exquisite creature, far above myself in every
respect. And now...!”</p>

<p>There was a pause. María, moved by this appeal,
folded her white hands and exclaimed fervently:</p>

<p>“O Lord! and my precious brother! come both of
you and help me!”</p>

<p>“Call upon them with a heart purified from all
baser affections, which are, as I may say, the rust of the
soul,” said Paoletti, feeling the fount of his eloquence
unsealed. “If you call upon them so, they will respond.
A fervent spiritual impulsion, my sweet friend,” and he
pressed his hand to his heart as though he were clutching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
it. “A deep yearning from the soul, an afflatus
arising from two aspirations: the desire to cast off this
foul body and the craving to fly up and away to the
radiant and serene realm above, never to return. Courage,
beautiful soul&mdash;on whose wings we may already
see the pearly reflections of the glorious day of Paradise&mdash;courage!
and let not your wings droop. You
are near the goal. Gaze upwards,” and he suited the
action to the word, “do not look down; that will make
you giddy&mdash;look up, and you will see the loveliness
and splendour that lies before you, infinitely beyond
anything that your fancy can dream of in its most rapturous
flights. There you will hear celestial strains, and
feel that exquisite and joyful ease which will wrap you
in ecstasy, in a robe of ravishment, and in heavenly
contemplation. Do not look back, seraphic soul, I entreat
you; for your own sake and for ours who look on
you as an example, for the Glory of God who made
you so perfect as His crowning work, for His own
pleasure and glory; on my knees I beseech you&mdash;I a
humble priest of no worth, of no account, but that it
has been my privilege to lead you in the path to eternal
joys, oh beatific soul! Thus winning some small merit
which is as nothing by the side of yours.”</p>

<p>There was a silence. Paoletti was a man of entire
good faith and meant all he said; he knelt down and
clasped his hands.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;on your knees,” murmured María. “No
no&mdash;not that. I will do as you desire me. But how
am I to escape from the feelings that possess me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Feel something different,” said the Italian rising.
“You must know it well; you who have schooled your
heart and mind with the care and watchfulness of a
saint. Do you experience any diminution in the fervour
or depth of your love to God, in your pious zeal?”</p>

<p>María waved her hand in negation. Then, turning
her head towards Paoletti that he might hear her better,
she said:</p>

<p>“And if I do not cast out&mdash;what you bid me cast
out, will it delay my salvation?”</p>

<p>“Nay, angel of goodness! Never for an instant
have I doubted of your salvation. What, can a soul so
full of merits be lost? Never.&mdash;There is no need for
you to tell me that these feelings which have come to
agitate you are untainted by rancour, and will not prevent
your full forgiveness of those by whom offences
have come. Am I wrong?”</p>

<p>María shook her head.</p>

<p>“Then your salvation is sure. If I try to eradicate
this insignificant weed it is only because I long to see
so lovely a soul absolutely spotless&mdash;because I cannot
be satisfied with a victory, but crave a triumph and long
to see you wear the crown, not merely of virtue but of
sanctity. What I desire,” he added enthusiastically, “is
that you should rise to Heaven bathed in light and
glory, hailed by rejoicing angels and that you should
not look back from the everlasting threshold of star-sown
sapphire, even to cast a glance of contempt at
this world. What I desire to see in you, is absolute
purity, the celestial essence of love!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>“All this I can have without being able to free myself
from earthly griefs. If I can be saved as I am,
God may take me as I am.”</p>

<p>Paoletti was silent; suddenly he said:</p>

<p>“My dear daughter, do you, with all your heart,
forgive those who have sinned against you?”</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said María, when the priest had given up all
hope of a reply. “I forgive my husband whose infidelity
has killed me.” And as she spoke the tears
flowed down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“And her, too&mdash;the woman who has robbed you
of your husband’s affection.&mdash;Do you forgive her?”</p>

<p>Paoletti stood waiting with his eyes fixed on the dying
woman’s face. María closed hers in deep abstraction.
The priest thought it was the end; he bent over
her in great alarm. But presently he heard a sob
which said: “Yes&mdash;her, too.”</p>

<p>“Then my beloved and noble daughter, if you forgive&mdash;which
is the only way to expel the evil leaven
from your soul, you will enter the gates of Heaven in
triumph,” said the Padre in a voice of dramatic solemnity.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that he held the key of
those gates. Suddenly, inspired as it seemed by the
supernatural influence the priest exercised over her,
María rallied her strength and particularly her powers
of voice. Even her pale cheeks recovered a tinge of
colour which gave fresh brilliancy and eagerness to her
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your words have given me new life!” she said,
without difficulty. “I had a cloud, a veil before my
eyes, and it has vanished; I see clearly&mdash;so clearly
that I can only marvel at the mercies the Lord has
vouchsafed to me in shedding this light on my soul,
and know not how to thank Him. He has shown me
the path by which I may go to Him, and called me with
the voice of His loving kindness. I will follow&mdash;I
come, I come, my God, Father and Redeemer, I clasp
thy cross!”</p>

<p>“This, this is what I longed for, my beloved penitent
and friend,” exclaimed the enraptured priest, while
tears started to his eyes and ran down his cheeks.
“Soon your spirit will dwell in the realms of eternal
bliss. How blessed is it, my daughter, to have no fear
of death, but, on the contrary, to look forward with joy
to the moment when the last spark of this miserable existence
is lost in the first radiance of a life of endless
glory! Sweetest soul, purified by prayer, by unfailing
piety, by heroic mortification of the evil within, by incessant
absorption into the divine idea&mdash;spread your
wings, whiter than sunlit clouds&mdash;fear not, soar upwards,
fix your eyes on the goal, open your ears to the
hymn that greets you, inhale the ineffable fragrance of
Paradise, be bold to enter the fatherly presence of the
Creator of the sun and stars&mdash;who will welcome you
with the smile which gave birth to light itself, and receive
you as a martyr and a saint.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;” said María folding her hands calmly
across her bosom. “I feel myself float upwards, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
can find no words to express my happiness. I feel as
if I had already forgotten the language of this world
and could not speak it. My last words still shall be
that I forgive with all my heart, those who have sinned
against me.”</p>

<p>There was a pause during which the priest murmured
a prayer.</p>

<p>“Father,” said María letting her hand fall on the
bed to rouse him from the mystic trance into which he
seemed to have fallen: “It strikes me that I ought to
tell my husband that I forgive him.”</p>

<p>“It is unnecessary, but you can do so.”</p>

<p>“Who knows but that a few words spoken in such
a solemn moment may not have an awakening effect on
his perishing soul.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; it is an idea worthy of your lovely
character.&mdash;We will tell him.”</p>

<p>“At such a moment,” added María recurring to the
ideas which Paoletti regarded as beneath her, and talking
with nervous eagerness, “he cannot contradict me.
Ah! he is so ready with his answers when I accuse
him that he sometimes confounds me. Once....”</p>

<p>She paused a minute and then went on. “Once he
came to me very melancholy and weary. It was a
very wet night&mdash;and the poor fellow, having lent his
carriage to a friend who was ill, was wet to the skin.
The same day a friend had died, to whom he was very
much attached, a well-known atheist, who, as you
know, had constantly shared my poor Leon’s studies
and opinions. Yes&mdash;he was very sad.&mdash;I pitied him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
as I saw him come in, but I was at my prayers, and I
could not interrupt them. He changed his clothes, but
he shivered just as much in his dry things as in his wet
ones; he was trembling with fever. I ordered the servants
to prepare some warm tea for him, and then went
on with my prayers, beseeching God that He would
touch his heart&mdash;but He never heard me!&mdash;Suddenly
Leon came and sat down by me on a low stool almost
at my feet, and took my hand and kissed it; his lips
were burning: ‘I want to love and to be loved,’ he
said. ‘Living like this, we are like two thistles growing
each by itself in a field.’ It was all I could do not to
listen to him. I was obliged to put down my prayer-book,
but I went on praying without it, and kept my
eyes fixed and my mind concentrated on holy things,
so as to keep out all other thoughts. That very day
you and I had talked together for a long time about
the tactics employed by an infidel mind to entrap the
godly. I fortified myself by recalling your words and
let the electric current of affection that came from me
to him pass by. I remained a perfect statue; I knew
that I ought to be angry, so I was, and I flung his
atheism in his teeth. He shivered with his chill and
said: ‘Well, as my home is empty for me, I will go to
some asylum.’ What things he said! ‘I want to love
and to be loved,’&mdash;he said that again and again. He
would laugh and pay me compliments like a boy; then
he would talk about the house, and the children we
never had.&mdash;But I was firm and as cold as ice, for if
I had shown him the least tenderness, how elated he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
would have been, and I utterly humiliated!&mdash;And I
should have felt that my humiliation was the abasement
of the Christian Faith and Church. My plan was
traced out for me&mdash;and how wisely! I rose from my
knees: ‘Be converted and then I will listen to you,’ I
said, and I left him alone.&mdash;How well I remember
that night. I remember that as I went into my own
room, I was quite grieved to see him so cold, and I
took a cloak down from the door. I had begun my
prayers again in my room when I heard him say:
‘Curses on those who made you what you are!’”</p>

<p>“But my beloved daughter,” said Paoletti, “you
are agitating yourself unduly with these reminiscences.”</p>

<p>“I think I can see him now!” she went on with
an ecstatic fire in her eye. “He was so pale, and his
eyes were full of a desolate melancholy&mdash;he looked
like a hungry child that puts out its arms to seek its
mother’s breast and finds a stone.&mdash;I fancy I can still
feel the rough touch of his beard on the back of my
hand, and the weight of his weary head on my knees.
I did not let it rest there, but I looked at him, asking
myself why God had allowed materialism and disbelief
to find a place in such a handsome head. And there
is something fascinating in his black eyes&mdash;the grasp
of his hand is so firm and manly&mdash;he has a combination
of gravity and brightness&mdash;strength that does not
detract from the beauty....”</p>

<p>“Friend of my soul,” interrupted Paoletti, “I conclude
that when you dwell at length on his perfections,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
it is only to wonder how the Omnipotent in his supreme
wisdom could join them to a blind soul, spiritually
dead.”</p>

<p>“Just so, just so.&mdash;But these memories crowd upon
me and I cannot shake them off. They are too strong
for me.&mdash;I remember one day, after several days of
disagreement, he came into the room quite furious. It
was the first time I ever saw him in a passion, and it
frightened me excessively. He spoke very violently,
took my hand and shook it as if he wanted to wrench
it off. I fell on my knees.&mdash;I fancy I can feel his hand
now with a grip like a vice; oh! if I really felt it I believe
it would make me wish to live!&mdash;He said cruel
things to me, but even though he was so angry, he
could not be brutal. This sudden fit of rage was in fact
a joy to me, for it showed me how much he loved me;
but as I had no doubts of his fidelity I did not choose
to make any show of affection. I knew very well that
he would not hurt me, so I said to him: ‘You
may kill me if you like, I do not care; but give me an
hour&mdash;I am dividing my clothes among the poor.’
That was the truth; above a hundred poor wretches were
waiting at the door. I was so proud of my charitable
action that I could afford to despise the tyrant.&mdash;And
he said: ‘It is horrible to have a wound aching in one’s
soul and not to be able to return blow for blow, to take
the smallest revenge, to kill or even to punish....’ But
ah! he was splendid in his wrath.”</p>

<p>“Enough of this,” said the priest with sudden decision
“I cannot allow another word of these memories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
which imperil your soul. You, who could then
struggle to keep your spirit pure, will surely not succumb
now.”</p>

<p>“No, I will not succumb”&mdash;said María, but there
was a look of anguish in her white face which betrayed
what it cost her to break the mysterious chains that
held her even in this supreme hour. “I have mortified
myself indeed, and fought many battles to divest my
mind of the sense of his attractions, and see the bare and
hideous skeleton of the man. It was you who advised
me to think of him as a skeleton&mdash;and it has been my
salvation.&mdash;For my soul would inevitably have been
lost.&mdash;Father, would it not?&mdash;if I had yielded to his
persuasions. It would have led me into sin&mdash;Father,
would it not?&mdash;He would have triumphed over me spiritually
speaking and have led my soul astray&mdash;Father,
would he not?” And at each question, betraying her
doubts and inward struggle, the priest replied by an emphatic
sign of assent. “I said to him: ‘I am yours in
all indifferent matters, but my spirit you shall never
subdue.’&mdash;Sometimes I forced myself to pass weeks
without saying a word to him&mdash;I was right, was I not?”</p>

<p>“My poor unfortunate friend,” said Paoletti with a
sigh, “you are asking me things you have asked a
thousand times before. Let us turn over this gloomy
page which we have amply discussed already, and discourse
of God and of forgiveness....”</p>

<p>“Of forgiveness!” said María raising her head without
moving her body. “Of what forgiveness?”</p>

<p>Her eyes had the wild glare that prognosticates delirium;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
she suddenly sat up in bed and clasping her
hands to her head, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I do not forgive, I do not forgive&mdash;I cannot&mdash;my
husband only&mdash;I forgive him. Leon I will forgive you
if you will return to me.&mdash;Not her, not her....” She
could say no more; she threw up her arms and fell back
as if she were dying.</p>

<p>Paoletti gazed at her in horror; María kept her eyes
fixed on his with a crazy glare. The priest felt the cold
sweat start on his brow, and his heart beat as though it
would burst his ribs. Presently María closed her eyes;
the crisis wore itself out in exhaustion, sighs, and sobs.
Paoletti said in tones which he meant to be awful:</p>

<p>“Thou Soul! that I believed to be victorious, and
that art yet yielding to the Foe: God will not forgive
those who show no forgiveness!” And falling on his
knees, he took the crucifix between his hands and prayed
in silence. He was in truth in deep distress&mdash;a shepherd
striving to save his favourite lamb. For some time
María neither spoke nor moved. At length, with a deep
sigh, she said in accents of despair: “I am a miserable
sinner and cannot hope to be saved.”</p>

<p>The hapless tortured soul was struggling like a shipwrecked
wretch, one hand stretched up to Heaven and
the other feeling for earth.</p>

<p>“I am overwhelmed with grief,” said Paoletti looking
up, and his face was wet with sincere tears. “The
soul that I believed I had won to fill a glorious throne
in Heaven, has suddenly fallen into the abyss....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Into the abyss,” echoed María with a heart-breaking
sob.</p>

<p>“And still I beseech the Lord that he will save it&mdash;that
he will save this most precious soul; that he will
not condemn it, that he will have mercy upon it.&mdash;Oh!
Merciful Saviour I have seen her Thine, wholly Thine,
and to see her now, given over to Satan!&mdash;Is she not
a pearl of great price? How canst Thou bear that
she should fall into the pit of everlasting punishment?
Hast Thou not purified and tried her as a jewel to be
worn by Thee throughout eternity? Hapless soul,” he
went on, turning to María, “listen to my last appeal if
you hope not to see the robe of purity and beatitude
turned into one of agonizing flames. Return to a better
mind; to that sweet and elect state which affords
greater delights than the most exquisite perfumes, the
most delicious food, and the loveliest sights on earth.
Save thyself yet, if not from this world, at least from
Hell!”</p>

<p>This vigorous allocution produced its effect; the
reverend orator continued to pour out his poetical eloquence,
not without feeling though somewhat theatrical
and full of figurative rhetoric; and lavishly adorned
with “celestial splendour, seraphic choirs, divine love,
and white-robed spirits.” When he had ended, María,
kissing the crucifix that her pastor put into her hands,
shed a few bitter tears as she said:</p>

<p>“I resign all to Thee, blessed Redeemer&mdash;there is
no leaven in my soul of baser affections. I resign them
all with my life and cast them into the fire. Still, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
thing remains; but you, Father, who can do everything,
can pluck out this last thorn from my heart.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Prove to me that Pepa’s child is not my husband’s.”</p>

<p>“How can I prove that, unfortunate woman?” cried
Paoletti thunderstruck. “How should I know the
secrets of hearts? It may be so, my child&mdash;and it
may not.” And then the worthy man, knowing only
the surface of human nature and not the depths of the
heart, added in perfect good faith: “She is a pretty
little girl.”</p>

<p>This was seizing a spear to pierce the heart and
shorten the agony. María writhed in her bed.</p>

<p>“Noble and beautiful soul,” exclaimed Paoletti rising
to his feet with glowing looks and an uplifted hand:
“Throw off this last earthly anxiety, cast away these
dregs of life, and keep the vessel pure to receive the
precious water of eternal glory.”</p>

<p>“I want to be saved,” murmured María, who now
looked more dead than alive.</p>

<p>“Then free yourself, purge your soul completely,
and forgive.”</p>

<p>“I do&mdash;I will&mdash;I forgive....” The words sounded
like the faint mysterious whisper of a soul escaping,
and dying on the lips of the speaker.</p>

<p>“Forgive, and your salvation is assured.” The
priest seemed to grow taller with his solemn and mystical
enthusiasm. María’s was mingled with a superstitious
terror which made her hair stand on end, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
hang dishevelled like grass swept down by the swift
rush of a passing train.</p>

<p>“Kiss this sacred image,” said Paoletti, “and forget
the world&mdash;totally, absolutely.”</p>

<p>“I do,” murmured María from the depths of the
gulf of self-mortification into which she had fallen.</p>

<p>“That there is such a thing as a man or woman in it.”</p>

<p>“I do,” said the voice, more softly, as though from
a lower depth.</p>

<p>“Let it be quite indifferent to you whether your
body is at Suertebella or in your own house. Mortify
your self-love to a conviction that the temporal triumphs
of the wicked cannot affect you. Divest yourself
of every feeling of aversion for this house, and remember
that the chapel here is dedicated to St. Luis
Gonzaga, whose very image and portrait our beloved
Luis was.”</p>

<p>This reminiscence seemed to rouse María.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I am reconciled to the place. The mere
sound of your name, my most blessed brother, fills me
with joy. May your glorified spirit come to succour
mine.”</p>

<p>“Amen, amen!” María kissed the crucifix.</p>

<p>“I wish all I possess&mdash;if I possess anything&mdash;to
be given to the poor. You and my husband will agree
about that. I wish to be buried by my brother’s side,
and let Masses be said over my body at the altar of the
saint I most venerate: St. Luis Gonzaga.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my beloved daughter. It cannot matter to
so noble a soul that the altar is at Suertebella.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing matters, I forgive with all my heart.&mdash;I
am reconciled to my Saviour and can hope!”</p>

<p>Paoletti with outstretched hands and half-closed
eyes solemnly, slowly pronounced absolution.</p>

<p>“Now that you are reconciled to God,” he said
with some emotion, “you can receive the Holy Sacrament.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />

VULNERANT OMNES, ULTIMA NECAT.</h2>


<p class="mt3">The ceremony took place at dusk with great pomp
and unction. The palatial house of Suertebella was
admirably suited to the ostentatious display of a splendid
ceremonial, the tribute of worldly wealth to an
august mystery. Exquisite flowers, and tapers innumerable
are thought the most proper offerings to do
honour to the Lord of Lords. Amid such dazzling accessories
even the works of human hands showed to
greater advantage; as though they too borrowed a reflection
of glory from the presence of the Deity. The
sounds of weeping which were audible here and there&mdash;in
a corner of the Chinese boudoir, or from behind
some Greek statue, whose majestic features looked like
an embodiment of the perfect balance of spirit and
matter&mdash;added to the melancholy solemnity of the
scene. Piety and dread, the one founded on reverence
and the other on the approach of Death, were blended
into a single emotion.</p>

<p>The priest of Polvoranca brought the sacred Host
from the church in a carriage sent for the purpose and
followed by a long train in slow procession. The very
horses seemed to understand that they ought to make
no noise and step quietly. The portico was crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
with people, under the ruddy glare of the torches they
held, in liveries and in plain dress&mdash;masters and servants,
all alike on their knees.</p>

<p>The little bell with its mysterious sound of consolation
and awe, echoes through the long corridors
rousing the marble figures from their stony dreams.
Comic or grave, the works of art seem to put on a semblance
of Christian reverence; the polished floors reflect
the gleam of tapers; flowers and tapestries seem to
bow in silent worship. Footsteps sound heavily on the
boards; they might be the distant roll of muffled funeral
drums. Presently they fall more dully on the
carpets, suggesting a subterranean procession. At last
they come to a standstill&mdash;there is silence as of the
grave: the procession has reached the chamber of
death. Then for a while the whole house is deserted;
all the inhabitants have collected in the immediate
vicinity of the closing scene. Those who cannot actually
witness it can fancy themselves in that room, filled
with light and suffering, and they sob and revel in the
picture, imagining what they cannot see. It is easily
conjured up, and their spirits quake before it. In the
halls and passages, all deserted and all blazing with
tapers, the still air gives an impression of suspended
breath, speechless and awe-stricken. There is not a
sound&mdash;except that in some remote corner there is a
rustle&mdash;as it were a whisper&mdash;of a woman’s dress that
stealthily hastens by and is lost in the distance.</p>

<p>Time goes on. Then at first a murmuring drone is
heard, steps again&mdash;the servants reappear with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
heavy tapers&mdash;the noise grows louder&mdash;the shadows
of the living fall on the painted figures on the walls and
across the waxed floors&mdash;the procession closes with a
gaudy array of liveries and dresses of every colour, men
and women of every degree; some quite callous faces,
others really sad or pitiful&mdash;the whole with its accompaniment
of prayer and response from the priest and
his acolytes. This procession, in which some walk with
a sort of rapture of grief while others are chilled with
dread, makes its way to the sound of a bell rung by a
boy&mdash;the very boy known to Monina as Guru&mdash;and
goes out again through the hall and portico where
some kneel to see it depart and others still follow with
bared heads.&mdash;Within, the scent of the flowers hangs
about the house as though it were the mysterious breath
of the invisible Guest who has passed through it.</p>

<p>“I am the Way and the Life and the Truth.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All the family had been present; the marquesa
prostrate on the floor in her anguish, unable even to
kneel, while her husband and sons were bitterly and
sincerely grieved. When the Sacrament was ended
they separated, all closely attended by their most intimate
friends. Milagros entirely lost consciousness;
she was carried to a sofa in the Chinese room where
her kind friends plied her with restoratives and sought
to give her consolation. The marquis, forgetting his
interest in the art and curiosities of the house, fled from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
his importunate comforters, and begged to be left alone.
He buried himself in a recess in the tapestried room,
behind a marble Satyr, and gave himself up to meditations
on the vanity of human grandeur. Gustavo
devoted himself to his mother and submitted to the
jeremiades of the poet of “pious raptures” and “white
souls.” Leopoldo did nothing but sigh; he was nervous
and tremulous, for the cold hand of death had come
so near to him that he fancied he could feel its touch.</p>

<p>Numbers of visitors were departing, and in the park
stood rows of carriages, the coachmen addressing each
other by their master’s name: “Garellano! You
there?”&mdash;“Cerinola, you’re wanted.”&mdash;“Lepanto,
move on a little.”</p>

<p>It was a beautiful night, calm and clear, lighted by
a pallid, full moon; the distant horizon looked deceptively
like a calm sea. The smaller stars sank into
insignificance, but the larger ones shone brightly, trembling
rather than twinkling. Nature was lovely and
seemed to breathe forth peace and love. It was an
hour to be born in, rather than to die in.</p>

<p>Nothing can make man feel so dwarfed as the contemplation
of the sublime indifference of the skies to all
the woes of earth. The most disastrous moral revolution
could never give rise to the tiniest film of cloud.
All the tears of weeping humanity will never form a
single drop of water in infinite space.</p>

<p>Leon came out of his wife’s room to express his
thanks to the master of the house.</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” said Fúcar, wringing his hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
“accept the sincere condolences of a much troubled
man. I myself am the victim of a very serious misfortune.”</p>

<p>“Is any one ill?”</p>

<p>“No, no; we will discuss it another day&mdash;this is
not the time.&mdash;Nay, nay, you have nothing to thank
me for; it was no more than my duty. As you see I
ordered them to decorate the house properly&mdash;suitably
for so solemn a ceremony, and as befits my firm religious
convictions. I had all the camellias brought in
from the green-house, and all the rhododendrons and
orange-trees in those heavy wooden tubs ... but there
are occasions when I grow reckless, when I think even
exaggeration is not out of place.... You shall know all
in good time ... we will talk it over....”</p>

<p>He went off to Madrid in his carriage, reflecting on
the catastrophe in his house, on the bad government of
a nation which, the day after issuing one loan, found it
necessary to start another.</p>

<p>Leon went back to his wife’s room. The end was
at hand. Rafaela, Paoletti, Moreno Rubio and himself
gathered round María who, since the last words of confession
she had uttered had been rapidly sinking, and
looked every moment more like death. Her face, which
nature had moulded on a type of ideal beauty, looked
even more perfect at this moment, when physical vitality
was almost extinct; and its fixity and whiteness, the immobility
of that calm repose on the pillow, the sculpturesque
stillness of every feature and muscle betraying no
sign of suffering, made her look like some marble image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
of Death&mdash;noble and dignified, with nothing vulgar in
its details&mdash;aristocratic, if so to speak, and wrought to
grace the monument of some great lady. She lay
motionless; she was privileged to enter the dark
realm with tranquil deliberation and free from bodily
pain, as we pass from one scene to another in the varying
phases of a dream.</p>

<p>Her half-closed eyes, under their black lashes, were
fixed on her husband’s gloomy and rigid face. Leon
stood by the bed, gazing sadly at the loveliness to which
Death was lending a sublimer beauty, and reflecting in
a vein of sentimental philosophy on this transformation
of his wife into a statue. The solemnity of the scene,
the silence, broken only by her breathing which grew
more difficult every moment, the sad fixity of those
dying eyes, fastened on him like a mysterious tendril
that could not be torn away, filled his brain with
thoughts of himself and of her,&mdash;two beings who
called themselves husband and wife, and between whom
there was no link but that gaze. He sounded the
depths of his soul, trying to find in it some faded remnant
of love, that he might offer it as a last blossom of
conjugal devotion to the woman who lay there dying
in the cold solitude of mysticism; but he sought in
vain&mdash;he could find none. All the wealth of love and
regard that his heart had once contained had been
diverted from its legitimate centre, and been stored and
hidden in another part of his nature.</p>

<p>But though he found no affection, the beautiful
creature who had been the pride of his earlier life filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
him with such deep and keen pity that he could, in that
hour of grief, have mistaken it for love. As he watched
the ebb of that life which might have been the crown
and joy of his own, Leon felt the tears rise to his eyes
and a tight grip on his heart. “Unhappy woman!” he
thought to himself. “May God forgive you for all the
ill you have done me; I mourn for you as if I had
loved you; and I pity you,&mdash;not so much for dying
young but for the cruel disappointment in store for you
when you learn&mdash;and you must learn it soon&mdash;that
the love of God is only a sublimer development of love
for those whom he has created!”</p>

<p>He went closer to her, attracted by her eyes which
had opened a little wider; he looked at the soft, almost
invisible down that shaded her lip, the bright light in
her eye, with its tawny hazel iris; he felt the warmth of
her breath&mdash;now scarcely perceptible.&mdash;Poor soul,
poor soul! There are no words to describe the pathos
which she could not utter in words, but only by the last
gleam of those eyes that were almost extinct.</p>

<p>Behind the external calmness of her attitude and
the steady gaze of her eye, who knows what anxieties,
what torments, nay what petty worries may not have
been racking her and dull jealousies vaguely stirring in
the depths of her dying soul&mdash;since there was no
physical means of giving them utterance! but the surface
betrayed nothing, just as the frozen surface of a
river prevents our hearing the swift and noisy flow of
the deeper current.</p>

<p>Leon understood this. He saw a tear glittering in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
each of María’s eyes: the last and only means of expression
for the one surviving human feeling of her soul,
brought from the unsounded depths to which the world
still clung by a slender root of desire. Two half-formed
tears, that did not overflow, were all that came to light
from that hidden fount. Leon bent down and pressed
his lips firmly to her cold forehead; as he did so he
heard a sigh of satisfied longing. A strong shudder
ran through her frame and in a steady voice she said:
“Ah! Thanks!”</p>

<p>There was silence&mdash;an awful silence, while María
Egyptiaca was tossing on the threshold of the invisible
land, like a grain of sand flung up by the waves on to
a shore where human ken cannot penetrate. The bystanders
murmured with a sigh that she was dead&mdash;they
might speak aloud now. Leon closed her eyes
with a timid hand&mdash;he was afraid of hurting her.</p>

<p>The priest on his knees prayed in silence, his eyes
tightly shut, like a prisoner whose dungeon windows
are closed with double shutters. Leon stood for a few
minutes, gazing at the remains of one of the most
beautiful women of her day&mdash;with the added reputation
of being the most saintly of her native city; and he
shuddered with grief as he remembered the past, and
realized what his present feelings were. How sad was
the stillness of those limbs not yet cold, of the features
in which beauty so masked death, that it would not
have been hard to call death life and life death.</p>

<p>Deeply agitated, and with his heart oppressed with
intense pity, he quitted the room, feeling as if he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
left his youth behind him. The devout watchers and
some of the servants remained there; Paoletti withdrew
to the chapel. The news flew through the house;
there was a sound of weeping, the bustle of attendants
rushing for restoratives, the sighs and lamentations
of friends coming and going. Leon took refuge in the
hall of Hymen, where he threw himself on a couch and
lay staring at an antique clock, which bore an inscription
on a semicircle above the dial, like a frowning
brow: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vulnerant omnes, ultima necat.</i></p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />

IN THE <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">INCROYABLE</i> DRAWING-ROOM.</h2>


<p class="mt3">He called together the servants and a few faithful
friends, and having made all the necessary arrangements
he withdrew to the end of the house nearest to his own
room. He felt he must be alone. In the midst of his
regrets he felt a certain satisfaction in having fulfilled
his duty to his wife to the last hour of her life. He ordered
his servant on no account to allow any one to
disturb him, and he locked himself in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Incroyable</i>
drawing-room.</p>

<p>At last he could enjoy the solitude he longed for;
he could think over the course of events, his own position
and the state of his mind; he cast a glance at the
past, and another at the future.</p>

<p>The painful struggle which he had carried on for so
long with an ideal differing from his own was now over.
He was free. But his freedom was tainted with sorrow,
for it had been granted him by death; and he had been
released from his fetters by a beautiful and melancholy
being, whom he could by no means hate but only pity
and respect. The obstacle that death had removed,
and which dwelt not merely in his memory but in his
heart, had won his tender sympathy by the mere fact of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
her pathetic end. It lent her the halo of innocence,
and the radiance of an angel.</p>

<p>Still dwell as he might on this image&mdash;an interesting
and touching one if not actually beloved&mdash;he
could not help feeling an impulse of happiness. The
future was before him. A door stood open&mdash;the door
to a new life, where perhaps he might find the realisation
of the dream he had indulged in so vainly in the
past life which was now buried in a peaceful grave.
The sense of recent loss made him afraid to contemplate
the future and kept his fancy so far chastened that
he did not rush into visions of rapturous days nor build
castles in the air, either in the sunny regions of the
probable, or the darker chaos of the purely imaginary.
It was with real pain that he felt the homage of pious
respect to the past chequered by visions of the future.
But hope, like remorse, is so inevitably a part of the
logic of events that it can be considered part and parcel
of our conscience. We cannot lock the door on remorse
when that intruder knocks and insists on admittance;
and in the same way, we cannot turn away hope when it
comes, walks in, calls us, invades us, takes possession,
settles itself deliberately, and unrolls the enchanting
panorama of happiness to come. No wilful blindness
will avail to prevent our gazing on the horizon of life
which is lighted up by hope; nay, there is not a moment,
however painful, which is not linked with those
hoped-for moments still remaining in store in the unknown
future. Life is a constant anticipation of something
remote and before us; indeed, nature herself has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
understood this law, for none of the superior creatures
have eyes behind them.</p>

<p>Thus he sat debating and suffering, not choosing to
let his thoughts wander whither they inevitably tended,
and taking a morbid pleasure in trying to relink his
broken chain. He felt a certain pride in setting aside
every thought of his own advantage, however legitimate,
and tried to force his fancy to a dignified indifference to
the more pleasing aspect of the events of the night.
But though the spirit has wondrous sails that bear it
onward, and without which it could make no way, it no
less needs that ballast which is called egoism. Egoism
is indispensable; without it the sails would flap idly,
and man would be the toy of the hurricane. With it,
and bereft of sails, he would be no better than a hulk.
The perfect vessel is one in which the sails and the ballast
are rightly proportioned.</p>

<p>As he reflected thus, Leon Roch made up his mind
that he could not be a hulk. Nay&mdash;he had just flung
all his ballast overboard to sail, as swift as lightning,
over the waters of a bright ideal when he heard a noise&mdash;a
sound that made him thrill as the rope of the topmast
vibrates before a rising storm&mdash;the rustle of a
woman’s dress and the murmur of a sigh. He looked
up and Pepa Fúcar stood before him.</p>

<p>Her aspect startled him, he could not ask her any
questions. Her face was like that of a corpse that has
risen from the grave in sheer terror of death. Her
teeth chattered as though she were cold. Tragedy itself
looked out of her eyes; in her hand she held a paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>With a great effort Leon said:</p>

<p>“For God’s sake leave me in peace&mdash;my poor
wife is dead.”</p>

<p>“And I ...” but she could not speak; she was
trembling, as though the chill of the grave had fallen
on her. At last she finished her sentence:</p>

<p>“I came, some time since, to tell you that my husband
is alive.”</p>

<p>Leon sat as if he had not heard; it was his conscience
which cried out:</p>

<p>“Your husband!”</p>

<p>“Is alive.”</p>

<p>She put her hand to her head, feeling as if all the
blood in her body were surging there.</p>

<p>“Have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I should have died of fear if it had not
been that you are here to protect me against that
ruffian!”</p>

<p>These words roused Leon from a sort of stupor.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;what have I to do with it?” he exclaimed as
though trying to fight his way out of this terrible nightmare
by some hypocrisy of dignity. “Leave me.
Have I anything to do with your husband&mdash;or with
you either?”</p>

<p>In his soul a storm was raging which he was trying
to quell by decency, honour&mdash;walls of sand which
broke down at a touch. His brain was in a whirl, and
conscious of no desire but that he could hate instead of
loving her, he ordered Pepa to leave the room. Giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
way to an impulse&mdash;whether of disgust or of honour he
hardly knew, he said:</p>

<p>“Leave me&mdash;I desire you to leave me. Do not
disturb me. I do not want you. I cast you from me&mdash;I
turn you out....”</p>

<p>“You are not in your right mind,” said Pepa sadly,
“you can turn me out of the room&mdash;but not out of
your heart.”</p>

<p>“Did you come here to mock me?” he went on
wildly, “when I most deserve your respect.... What
you have told me is a lie.”</p>

<p>“Ah! would to God it were!” said the poor woman
clasping her hands. “My father told me the dreadful
news this morning; but I did not think he would dare
to appear before me. But this evening, I was sitting
in my room, and I heard a noise in the garden&mdash;I
went to the window&mdash;I saw a man&mdash;it was he.
The light from the hall lamp fell on his hated face&mdash;I
saw him and knew him. I thought the earth would
open and swallow me&mdash;I was shivering with cold and
fear. I could not help running&mdash;running all over the
house, and fancying I heard him close behind me and
felt his hand on my shoulder. I rushed out of the back
door&mdash;if there had been no door I must have jumped
out of the window. I went into the yard&mdash;I could
not stop&mdash;out into the street. There I took a hackney
carriage and flew here to tell you. I waited a long
time in the museum; then I was out of patience....”</p>

<p>“And the child?”</p>

<p>“She is not at home. I should have brought her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
with me if she had been; but Papa had taken her this
evening to see Countess Vera. I had intended to go
too&mdash;but I knew what was going on here and I could
not bear to go into company; I said I was not well
enough.”</p>

<p>“And what a time for coming here!” exclaimed
Leon bitterly. “You cannot even comfort me.”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you object to in my presence?”</p>

<p>“It is a profanation, a scandal! I have no words
for it; it fills me with a horror that I cannot overcome.”</p>

<p>“I am not to blame for what has happened.&mdash;It
is God’s will and ordering.&mdash;But do not let us lose
time in lamentations; let us consider, let us decide
what we are to do.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“We&mdash;you and I.&mdash;Will you abandon me to my
fate in this unequal struggle? Do you know what that
wretch means to do?&mdash;My father told me all about
it. He has been two days in Madrid staying in his
uncle’s house on purpose to spy me and watch me.&mdash;I
do not know who can have told him, his uncles I
suppose. Gustavo is his lawyer, and he is going to
bring a charge against me.&mdash;And the base wretch
could write to my father this morning, declaring that
he had repented of all his wickedness, and imploring
his forgiveness.&mdash;Inside that letter there was a note
for me. Read it.”</p>

<p>Leon’s first impulse was to refuse to look at the
letter; but he snatched it out of Pepa’s hand, he knew
not how or why; and read as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>“A man who is dead has no right to expect fidelity
in the wife who survives him. Happily for me, the Almighty
saw fit to save my precious life. As the moment
draws near when I may hope to embrace my wife
and child, I have the honour of informing the first of
those beloved beings that I have made up my mind to
forgive her, provided she hastens to submit to my authority
as a husband, seeing that my supposed departure
from this world is some excuse for her delinquency.
At the same time if the above-mentioned beloved being
persists in believing that I am still food for the fish in
the Gulf of Mexico, I hereby take the liberty of assuring
her that I shall avail myself of the rights granted to
me by law. My dear daughter cannot be allowed to
grow up in the lap of such a mother. I am sure
that the lady whose husband I have the honour to
be will not prefer the delights of a criminal attachment
to the sweet duties of motherhood&mdash;but, if she should,
I shall bring an action in due form, having an abundance
of witnesses who can prove the preliminary information
required by law, and I shall claim my
daughter, since the law will place her in my paternal
care as soon as she is three years old.</p>

<p>“In order that my estimable wife may fully appreciate
the strength of my position as an injured husband,
I would beg her to spend an hour in her father’s library,
and there, in the third book-case, on the second shelf,
she will find the last edition of the code, in which interesting
work I would advise her to study Act 20, cap. I,
clause II.</p>

<p class="right">“F. Cimarra.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is the man, all over!” exclaimed Leon crumpling
up the paper. “His style, his insolence, his
mean irony, his absolute lack of decency and feeling.
I know the hand that strikes me&mdash;God in Heaven!
If such an attack, from such a villain, is not enough to
justify a man in trampling on all law and custom, in
forgetting his dignity nay, and his conscience&mdash;if this
is not an excuse for rebellion and fury, I do not want to
live!&mdash;life is not worth having!” He flung the paper
on the floor and Pepa set her foot on it.</p>

<p>“And I will do the same to you, vile wretch, and
your latest Code!” she exclaimed. Then she dropped
on the sofa and bursting into tears she went on:</p>

<p>“And to think of my baby, my little Monina in the
hands of that ruffian. Monina, who is my only joy,
snatched away from you and me! The mere thought
of such a thing drives me mad.”</p>

<p>Leon looked at the floor with stern determination.</p>

<p>“A bold stroke on my part may save us yet,” said
Pepa, looking up with a resolute flash.</p>

<p>“Hush&mdash;wait&mdash;” said Leon anxiously putting up
his hand. “Listen.”</p>

<p>They were silent, holding their breath even.</p>

<p>And they heard in the corridor the slow solemn
steps of many men carrying some heavy burden. The
sound came nearer, passed, and died away. Pepa and
Leon each in the attitude of holding the other back, listened
in reverent silence to the procession that passed
so near to them. Their beating hearts seemed to throb
in unison. When silence had once more fallen on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
house Leon looked at Pepa who had bent her head
and whose eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>“Are you praying?” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh! God!” exclaimed Pepa clasping her hands
over her heart. “She is at peace,&mdash;I am tortured
with grief and anxiety; she is enjoying eternal bliss as
the reward of her virtues, and I am pointed at as a
guilty creature, threatened with persecution, and my
wretched heart is to be made the sport of the tricks of
the law.&mdash;No, merciful Lord! I never prayed that
she might die in order that I might triumph and be
happy&mdash;that I never asked. I was not so wicked,
and I do not deserve such punishment.&mdash;I hated her
sometimes it is true, but not now, not now. I do not
know whether I am afraid of her now, or whether it is
only reverence that keeps her always in my thoughts&mdash;I
see her before me wherever I turn, dead, and yet
living.”</p>

<p>“She is happy!” said Leon in dull tones.</p>

<p>“But we have no time to be melancholy. We
must decide, and act at once. Listen, I have a plan;
the best, the only plan....”</p>

<p>“A plan.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will tell you. First I must fetch my child.
I feel as if they wanted to take her from me, as if you
and she and I were in danger....”</p>

<p>“Fetch her now, at once.”</p>

<p>“It is only ten o’clock. There is time to go and
return quickly. I have spoken to Lorenzo, our best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
coachman, and the carriage is waiting. Will you
promise to wait here till I return?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I promise,” said Leon looking at her but beyond
her. “Fly and fetch Monina; bring her quickly;
I too am afraid....”</p>

<p>“Till then do not stir from hence....”</p>

<p>She went away through the museum.</p>

<p>Leon for a long time could not restore order in his
mind. Before deciding on any definite course of action
it was necessary to form a clear idea of the situation
in its true aspect and proportions, without regarding
it as better or as worse than it really was. But in
spite of every effort he could not think with any kind
of lucidity; all mental discipline was lost to him. His
utter physical exhaustion and the moral chaos that had
come upon him had resulted in a sort of lethargy, in
which his brain was lulled to sleep while his senses ran
riot in feverish disorder. We have once before seen
him in a similar mood.</p>

<p>The room seemed to assume a circular shape, for
his eyes were incapable of taking exact note of what
they saw, and the walls spun round him and with them
in a giddy whirl the objects that adorned them. These
were for the most part engravings, plates, jars, medals
and plaster reliefs of the time of the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Directoire</i>,
when a revolution in taste took place as a trivial corollary
to the revolution in politics. After cutting off
heads the mania for innovation set to work to reform
hats. Industry had no mind to retire in favour of
liberty, and on the top of the mound of skulls piled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
during the reign of terror, it stuck a dress-maker’s
doll.</p>

<p>There were men tightly buttoned into impossible
coats, choked in yards of neck-cloth, and crowned with
incredible hats. Some carried knotted sticks, others
twisted canes; they were curled like the Furies and
shod like dancing-masters. Some had huge chains
with seals like bell-clappers hanging from their pockets;
in some it was difficult to distinguish their legs from
their skirts, or where the man ended and his clothes
began. They looked like objects in a nightmare, chimeras,
the distorted metamorphosis of human beings
into long-legged wading birds with glasses on their bills
and buskins on their feet. The women displayed more
than their ankles in tightly-drawn stockings, and on
their heads wore towers of felt, fur and feathers, buckram,
and ribbands; mounds, weather-cocks, pagodas,
spires or tubs. If a crowd of witches had set up for
being fashionable they might have appeared in such a
guise.</p>

<p>All these figures seemed to be flying in a mad race
round the room. They were a motley rabble, a whirling
tornado of cudgels, legs, noses, eyeglasses, petticoats,
fans and hats, whence proceeded whistling,
shouts, scoffing and laughter. All humanity rammed
into a cannon as large as the world, and fired off into
the air in a million fragments, could not have covered
the sky with a more hideous cloud.</p>

<p>Leon saw a figure step out of the circle and come
towards him, and he suddenly felt an impulse of rage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
just like that which he had felt in the morning against
his brother-in-law&mdash;a rage which now no consideration
of respect interfered to quell. The hateful figure that
approached him was the most grotesquely monstrous of
all that crazy rout; his mean smile was an insult to
human reason, to decency, to virtue, to everything that
distinguishes man from brutes.</p>

<p>“Horrible wretch!” Leon cried&mdash;or fancied he
cried, rushing upon him, and seizing him by the collar.
“Do you think I am afraid of you? Why do you
take her from me? Yours! do you say she is yours?
But I will give you a lesson and rid society of your vile
presence....”</p>

<p>He clutched his victim with all his strength, saying:</p>

<p>“You have rights? I trample them under foot.
You have ties? I break them. You shall soon see
what I care for your rights and ties&mdash;no more than for
your life, which is full of evil and disgrace. I loathe
you as the embodiment of all the wickedness on earth.&mdash;Respect
you? Respect the law, the sacrament
which you represent as I respected them in her who is
no longer of this world?&mdash;How dare you name her in
the same breath with yourself? In her I respected the
austerity of virtue, of exalted piety, honour, innocence,
weakness and beauty. But what is there in you but
corruption, lies and foulest vice?&mdash;It is in vain for you
to crave my pity: pity was not made to bestow on venomous
reptiles. Do not ask me to let you have your
child.&mdash;Shall an angel be thrown to the dogs?&mdash;Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
child loathes you, your wife hates you, I&mdash;I will
murder you!”</p>

<p>He felt as though he were rolling down a precipice
in the dark, with his victim in his grasp. Then he unconsciously
sank into a troubled slumber that lasted
some time. He woke in a calmer frame of mind;
though still confused, he could make out surrounding
objects, and by degrees saw them more distinctly.
The figures on the walls were in their places, as insolently
lifelike as ever, not more hideous or more pleasing
than of old. Leon heard not a sound; everything was
still. He looked at his watch; it was half-past eleven.</p>

<p>His first clear idea was that he must at once quit
the house and go to his own home.</p>

<p>He thought of María dead, and of Pepa living,&mdash;he
saw them as though they had been standing side by
side in front of him; and at the same moment, as if his
thought had evoked her presence, Pepa came into the
room from the museum with Monina in her arms.</p>

IMPOSSIBILITIES.</h2>


<p class="mt3">“Here she is!” she said with pride. “You see I
have had to carry her.”</p>

<p>She was quite out of breath and could scarcely
speak.</p>

<p>The poor little child, sleepy and cross, allowed
Leon to take her in his arms and laid her head on his
shoulder only to fall asleep again.</p>

<p>“Have you nothing to say to him?” said Pepa,
caressing one of her little hands. “Mona, my pretty
one, tell him what I said to you.”</p>

<p>The little one shut her eyes, murmured a few words
and gave herself up to sleep, without a fear or a care,
on the very brink of the gulf that yawned at her deluded
mother’s feet.</p>

<p>“She is asleep,” said Leon gently drawing the
curly head to a more comfortable position on his
shoulder. “We must talk very softly, since the force
of circumstances compels us to meet and to speak.”</p>

<p>“We cannot stay here: we should be overheard
from the corridor,” said Pepa taking him by the hand.
“Besides, I must show you something which is in another
part of the house. Come with me.”</p>

<p>He obeyed her. Pepa opened the door into the museum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
There was a candle which she lighted; she led
the way through a room full of old pictures, into a
second and a third one, Leon carrying Monina, followed
her without a word. At last he saw where he was.</p>

<p>“Here we shall not be disturbed by intruders, or by
that mob of simpletons who have invaded the house,”
she said.</p>

<p>They went into the very room where Monina had
lain ill with the croup. A woman was there prepared to
take Pepa’s orders; she was the wife of one of the men
about the place whom Pepa could trust, and as her
own maids were at Madrid, she had got this woman to
attend to Mona, who was at once put to bed. Teresa
sat down by the bed, strictly enjoined to call out if any
one came into the room; then Pepa led Leon into the
next room.</p>

<p>“This is my own room,” she said, “no one can
hear us here. And now for my secret. Sit down.
Mercy how pale you are!&mdash;And I?”</p>

<p>“You are pale, too,” said Leon sitting down
wearily.</p>

<p>“We reflect each other,” she said, trying to sweeten
by a slight jest the gall they both had to drink. Leon
was in no mood to notice the elegance of the bedroom,
in which the magnificence of the decorations was such
as, in the days of faith, was lavished on chapels and
altars. He paid no heed to the handsome tables and
wardrobes of ebony inlaid with marbles, to the monumental
bed, also of ebony, which, with its vast spread
of mattresses and pillows, covered with some curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
dark-hued cloth of gold, looked singularly like a catafalque;
he did not glance at the religious pictures in
their silver frames&mdash;some like those that his wife had
loved&mdash;nor at the elegant lamp that had just been
lighted and shed a discreet and moon-like light in the
room. At any other time its splendour would have attracted
his attention, but not now.</p>

<p>“Your secret? What is your secret?” he said impatiently.</p>

<p>“My secret,” repeated Pepa sadly, “it is that we
will fly, fly&mdash;you have only to consent, and we will go
at once&mdash;we three, without being seen by a soul.”</p>

<p>“Fly! What mad folly!” he exclaimed, striking
his forehead with his hand. “And at such a moment!
Your conscience, my own, our very love itself rises up
in protest against such an idea. Can you forget what
has this moment taken place under this roof?&mdash;Good
Heavens! You expect me to be devoid of the respect
and consideration due to the dead! You ask me,
when these hands have scarcely closed her eyes&mdash;!
What should I be if I could consent! I should deserve
to fall even lower than those calumniators who are so
ready to call me María’s murderer.&mdash;I cannot conceive
that you could love me if you should see me suddenly
fall into such depths of baseness, if I were capable
of anything so hideously iniquitous and immoral.”</p>

<p>Every word was a twist to the rope that was strangling
the hapless Pepa. They both were silent for
some time, without looking at each other. Suddenly
she laid her hand on his arm, gazing at him with haggard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
eyes, and said in a voice he never before had
heard from her:</p>

<p>“Very well&mdash;then I will go to my husband.”</p>

<p>“What! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing for it but to submit to him. Can
I put it more plainly. Either I fly with you, or I go
into the wild beast’s cage.” Leon felt an internal
shock; his soul seemed to leap up within him, to bound
from its central seat.</p>

<p>“Plainer still?” she went on, going close up to him
and leaning over him so that he might mark the angry
glare of her small eyes. “Gustavo can give you the
fullest details. Gustavo came to Papa this morning to
explain to him my husband’s claims. Federico is his
client; the creature has entrusted the defense of his
rights to that man.”</p>

<p>“Now I understand why he threatened me with
some mysterious punishment.&mdash;And were you present
at his interview with your father?”</p>

<p>“Yes.&mdash;My father had just been telling me that it
was this resurrection of the enemy that had been troubling
him so much&mdash;he had heard that Federico had
returned. Pilar told him last night that he was here.&mdash;The
shock had quite taken away my breath, when in
came the pompous lawyer. He came, he said, as the
friend of both parties, and most anxious to compromise
matters rather than bring them into court. The hypocrite!
His roundabout speeches gave us the sensation
of the jarring of a machine that wants oiling, which
tortures one’s nerves and makes one’s head ache....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
My father and he went on for ever so long, beating
about the bush with high-flown phrases that made me
furious. I should have turned the lawyer out of the
house. But you can imagine his ponderous emphasis
and the complacent twaddle with which he tormented
me&mdash;and after talking for an age, he explained that he
had already drawn up a statement of the case.”</p>

<p>Pepa paused to take breath and recruit her moral
energies, of which she seemed to have an inexhaustible
supply.</p>

<p>“My father,” she went on, “put forward a great
many arguments and considerations. I said that the
man who was brave enough to take my child from me,
might come and drag her out of my arms. I believe
that in my indignation I said very rude things to Gustavo.
He apologized for his interference, alleging that
he was merely an agent. All he wished was that we
should come to an agreement, that the best course
would be a friendly compromise, so as not to give rise
to a scandal. I tried to defend myself against the horrible
insinuations as to my own character, but an uneasy
conscience checked me; I blundered and hesitated, and
in trying to prove myself innocent I believe I did the
very reverse.”</p>

<p>“And what more did the raving moralist say?”</p>

<p>“He went on for about half an hour quoting laws,”
said Pepa, again trying to infuse a drop of humour in
her bitter cup. “He began with Deuteronomy, went
on to the Germans and Tacitus, and then referred to
various modern authorities; finally, thinking he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
not bored us enough, he quoted sections, chapters,
schedules&mdash;what not? I really was amused as I listened
to him....”</p>

<p>“You were amused?”</p>

<p>“Yes,&mdash;I thought what fun it would be to put
him in the middle of our big pond and let him declaim
to the frogs and fishes.&mdash;He was extremely tedious,
telling me in the most elaborate and polite terms
that the law was entirely on his client’s side, and that
nothing could be easier than to prove me guilty. He
has plenty of witnesses.”</p>

<p>“Witnesses? To what? Oh! I do not believe they
can prove anything in spite of his malice. But they
can calumniate you, disgrace you, drag your name and
character in the mire; and you may lose your child
when she has reached the age prescribed by law. If we
fly we shall only be helping them to prove their case,
and then you would be sure to lose the child.”</p>

<p>“But if we went a long way off?”</p>

<p>“Do not take a panic. Do not think of flight,
which would condemn you unheard. While he brings
an action against you, you must invoke the intervention
of the law, to prevent him from exercising his
paternal authority, on the ground of his extravagance,
of misappropriation of moneys, forgery&mdash;a whole catalogue
of crimes that it will be easy to prove if your
father will support you.”</p>

<p>“I see what you mean. But you are under a delusion.
You do not know the worst.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“You think, no doubt, that my father warmly took
my part?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“But you are mistaken. Alas for me&mdash;and for you,
too, dear friend of my soul&mdash;we are alone and undefended;
everything, every one, is against us: religion,
laws, relations&mdash;the good and the evil alike&mdash;the
whole world. When the great Gustavo enlarged on
the legal advantage his client had over me I flew into a
rage&mdash;still, I controlled myself to say that Federico
could not insist on exercising paternal authority, and
that if he was determined on a quarrel I would accuse
him of the things you know of. My father listened to all
this very calmly; I saw him ready to yield to all sorts
of odious compromises.... He stuttered and stammered,
and made speeches that turned my heart cold:
‘My daughter will be reasonable&mdash;we must all make
some sacrifice&mdash;I, if Federico will meet me half way&mdash;well,
we must see&mdash;perhaps we can do everything he
wishes&mdash;the first point is to avoid a scandal.’&mdash;And
this point of avoiding a scandal, which he recurred to
at least twenty times, showed me that he is not prepared
to defend me as I should wish.&mdash;A compromise! And
with what a man! Good God! Then he talked of coming
to terms with Federico’s uncles, two very worthy
men whom you know; one is a judge in the supreme
court and the other president of the examining body&mdash;What
will come of it all? What do you think of it&mdash;what
can you say to it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>“That if your father deserts you, you must fight
alone.”</p>

<p>“Just so, and I will fight alone. Thank you for that.
You restore my courage which my father crushes entirely
with his extraordinary antipathy to ‘exaggeration,’”
exclaimed Pepa with eager vehemence. ”If
when you know what my weapons are!&mdash;It was to
show you those that I brought you here. You shall
see.”</p>

<p>In one corner of the room Leon observed an inlaid
cabinet which Pepa now pointed to; it was not very
large, of elegant workmanship, but evidently solidly
constructed. She went up to this bureau, and opening
the outer doors revealed a whole series of smaller doors,
pigeon-holes and drawers. She touched a spring and a
secret division flew open.</p>

<p>“This part of the cabinet,” she said with a smile,
“is the <i>Ark of sorrows</i>.&mdash;Now, do you know that?”</p>

<p>“It is a letter of mine.”</p>

<p>“You wrote it to me when you were at college, preparing
for the School of Mines.... Read it and meditate
on what you wrote to me then: ‘That you
were madly in love with me....’ You may laugh now,
if you can, at your youthful folly.&mdash;Why did you not
treasure up my letters as I did yours? I did not say
that my love was a madness, but it filled my soul and
moulded my nature, as everything does that is an eternal
part of it.&mdash;And this; do you know this?”</p>

<p>“It is a tie-pin,” he said taking it up. “It was
mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;you dropped it in our house one day when
you came to dinner. You were engaged then to that
poor soul, but I still hoped you would not marry her.&mdash;I
found it lying on the carpet and I kept it.&mdash;And
these flowers?”</p>

<p>“They are some camellias I gave you once on your
fête day&mdash;San José.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the next evening you came to see me in
my box and I saw you looking with the greatest interest
at....”</p>

<p>“Poor flowers!&mdash;I did not think to see them
again, or that they could speak to me as they do now,
reminding me of all the feelings and dreams of my life.
Do you know they are not dried up as I should have
expected them to be after such a length of time?”</p>

<p>“My kisses have embalmed them and kept them
fresh&mdash;kisses that I have given them so often!&mdash;But
we must not delay. Give me all that.”</p>

<p>She replaced the objects in their little nook, with
as reverent a touch as though they had been the most
precious relics.</p>

<p>“Stay there in your melancholy little sleep, poor
little treasures,” she said. Then she went on: “Now
that you have seen the Ark of Sorrows I will show you
the Chamber of Horrors!”</p>

<p>She opened a concealed drawer and took out a
packet of papers tied together with red tape, like lawyers’
letters. Leon took it, understanding what it must
contain, and they sat down to examine it.</p>

<p>“Here,” said Pepa with a shudder, at the sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
this record of disgrace, “here is the evidence of the
martyrdom I have suffered as the wife of that reprobate:
vile secrets that he confided to me under pressure
of circumstances, when he wanted money. Every
page is the record of some act of villainy that I concealed
with the greatest care; the evidence of crimes
that I succeeded in frustrating, or which remained hidden
among the rubbish of some government office.
Look at them, and you will see that I have ample
means of proving that my husband is disqualified not
merely for exercising paternal rights, but even for holding
a place in anything like decent society.”</p>

<p>Leon looked through the packet with considerable
curiosity, glancing over some things, and reading others
with care. There were letters to and from well-known
firms, private contracts, memoranda, accounts, papers
with government seals, pages which had evidently been
extracted from important documents, and a judicial decision
which had obviously been signed under a false
impression or in a moment of surprise.&mdash;When he
had examined them all, he returned the packet to Pepa.</p>

<p>“Burn it,” he said.</p>

<p>“What?” she exclaimed, holding out her hand, but
not taking it in her astonishment. “Shall I find them
of no use?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Leon.</p>

<p>“How is that? Can I do nothing with them?”</p>

<p>“You can certainly&mdash;but....”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“In such painful circumstances it is best to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
quite plainly.&mdash;We owe each other the truth, though
it may crush the being we love best in the world.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Burn all this.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Burn it,&mdash;because you must not use it. It is a
two-edged sword which will wound you when you use
it. Forgive my entire frankness; with this in your
hand you could triumphantly attack your husband.
Under the feeblest rule of justice there is enough here
to throw a man into prison.&mdash;But if you achieve that
the wretch would meet his fate in good company....”</p>

<p>“In good company?”</p>

<p>“The fact is that, in Spain, men of a certain stamp
are never put into prison even if they deserve it. This
horrible revelation might easily heap disgrace....”</p>

<p>“On others?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and on one whom you truly love and could
not bear to injure. Burn them all, Pepa, for God’s
sake.” The poor woman pressed her hand tightly to
her eyes to check her tears. But with a fresh flash of
her unquenchable spirit, she took up the packet and replaced
it in the Chamber of Horrors, which she locked,
saying:</p>

<p>“I will burn them at another time.” Then turning
to Leon she said in a low voice:</p>

<p>“Then I can do nothing legally to incapacitate my
husband?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is it impossible that I should take legal measures
against him?”</p>

<p>“Impossible. I understand now your father’s hesitancy,
his weak submission, which is neither more nor
less than fear&mdash;the fear of going to law with an enemy
who has been his accomplice. It is altogether out of
the question, my dearest.”</p>

<p>“Quite, quite.&mdash;Why should we try to find
crooked ways of escape? My friend, my lover&mdash;husband&mdash;all
in all, the only soul to which my soul is kin,
dare as much as I can dare!” she exclaimed with that
fervid courage which sometimes made her so beautiful.
“The straight and easy way lies before us, the only
way: Flight. The carriage is waiting; there is nothing
to stop us, we want nothing. You are rich&mdash;I am
even richer&mdash;everything favours us, urges us to
act....”</p>

<p>“Impossible! Madness!” said Leon gloomily.</p>

<p>“Madness? It seems so, I admit, but it is not
mad really.&mdash;It seems monstrous and scandalous, and
yet to me&mdash;knowing the danger and knowing the foe
we have to deal with it is perfectly natural. Do you
suppose I would propose such a thing to you if it were
not necessary? You do not know, you do not see that
I and Monina and you are in imminent danger. I
dread some insult&mdash;a duel&mdash;a murder.&mdash;Every moment
is precious. He respects nothing. I expect
every instant to see him come in....”</p>

<p>“No, and again no,” repeated Leon with a determination
that was almost cruel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Pepa, who with all her temerity was still under his
dominion, dared no longer protest against this resolute
pride, and insist on taking the only path to happiness
that lay open to her. She was afraid that her obstinacy
might provoke further difficulties, and she stood
looking at the Sphinx, hoping that a solution of the
problem might suggest itself, instead of that which to
her looked so easy. At length, tired of waiting, she
said:</p>

<p>“Then if everything is impossible I must do as my
father desires me, and receive the wretch with open
arms.”</p>

<p>“You, in the power of that brute!” exclaimed
Leon; the cord, stretched to the utmost, snapped
asunder. “Before that can happen I must have lost
every drop of blood in my body.”</p>

<p>“Well, if the monster can be gorged with the Code,”
said Pepa sarcastically, “I will fling my child to him
and come to live with you.”</p>

<p>“Part with the child?”</p>

<p>“You see,&mdash;that is still more impossible. Whichever
way I turn I see nothing but impossibilities.”</p>

<p>“Nay, there is one point,” said Leon meditating,
“from which we can look and see something besides
the impossible.”</p>

<p>“And where is it?”</p>

<p>“You shall know in good time; but first I must
talk to your father, and to your husband.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I will speak with him&mdash;or with his uncles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
who are honourable and respectable men. Can you
imagine no way in which the matter may be settled
without flying, or going to law?”</p>

<p>“By my going to him?”</p>

<p>“Without even that.”</p>

<p>“I know of none.”</p>

<p>“But I do.”</p>

<p>“Then you know of some way of working miracles.&mdash;No,
no miracle will do here. The only real miracle
is flight.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then we must fight it; we will fight him together,
you and I.”</p>

<p>“You and I? Then we should lose, and your
child would be taken from you without fail.”</p>

<p>“Well then; as you close every way of escape,
open another; it is the least you can do.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” said Leon sadly and looking at the
floor: “I will open the only way there is.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” cried Pepa with a gesture of indignant
impatience, and then relapsing into dejection as a
glowing cinder suddenly becomes mere ashes. “Your
to-morrows kill me!”</p>

<p>“Then you insist on the idea of flying?”</p>

<p>“I insist, because every minute you stay here, that
I and my child stay here, but increases the peril for
all of us. This night, which to you is one of mourning,
is the turning point of my fate. He is capable&mdash;how
can I tell! I fear the worst and tremble at every
sound. I am so miserably afraid.&mdash;I know that if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
heard of your being here, he would come and insult
you,&mdash;fancy your fighting with him!&mdash;I am afraid of
his insulting her, of his coming before me face to face.
He always hated you.... I am afraid even that he
might assassinate you.&mdash;I feel as though every conceivable
horror were closing round me&mdash;I seem to see
blood.&mdash;And it would be so easy now to step out of
this circle of terrors. Oh! take me away and give me
shelter in your house.”</p>

<p>“Everything in good time.”</p>

<p>“Will you wait for me there?”</p>

<p>Leon was on the point of replying, when he thought
he heard steps and talking behind one of the doors.</p>

<p>“Where does that door lead to?” he asked in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Into a room opening into the Chinese boudoir.”</p>

<p>“You see; they are watching all we do, listening to
all we say. Those are the witnesses preparing their
evidence.”</p>

<p>“God knows who they may be! Suppose it were my
husband....” said Pepa in Leon’s ear, like thief talking to
thief in the silence of the room they have robbed.
“Suppose he were to come in here. He might kill us
both and hardly be blamed for it. The law would protect
him; you are in his wife’s room.”</p>

<p>A cold shiver ran through every vein in Leon’s body.</p>

<p>“Hush,” he whispered to Pepa. “Some one is spying
us. But the voices are those of inquisitive women
and stupid men servants. They have no weapons but
their tongues.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>“And we are here that the witnesses may rehearse
their parts!” exclaimed Pepa starting away from him
and rushing to the door, like a lioness at bay. “Who
is there, listening, prying, watching me, with his ear to
my keyhole? I am at home, in my own house, and
those who treat me with disrespect shall suffer for it!”
Then turning to Leon she went on: “And still you
doubt! Danger surrounds us&mdash;I tremble for your life,
for everything I hold dear.”</p>

<p>Outside the door there was silence; they heard the
soft footfall of women creeping away.</p>

<p>“You hear those cat-like steps,” he said. “Cowards
like that do not kill, but they will scratch our faces.”</p>

<p>As he spoke they both started with alarm at hearing
some one come into Monina’s room. It was the Marquis
de Fúcar. He was much agitated.</p>

<p>“I must speak to my daughter,” he said to Leon
very solemnly. “What would become of her if an
anxious father.... And then a few words with you,
Leon. No, it will be better that I should talk to you
first.... It is a most delicate subject.&mdash;I have just
come&mdash;my dear Pepa, one moment. Leon and I have
two words to say to each other. We will go into the
child’s room.”</p>

<p>Pepa was left alone; she could hear the voices of
her father and her friend, but could distinguish no words.
In a few minutes Don Pedro came back to Pepa alone;
she looked anxiously at the door for Leon’s return; but,
as her father told her, they had agreed that Leon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
should not be present at the interview between the
father and daughter.</p>

<p>Leon withdrew to the room he had been quartered
in, not far from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Incroyable</i> room, and spent a night
of cruel anxiety and internal struggle. At first it was
like a violent argument between two contending parties.
Then the turmoil in his soul took the form of crucial
questions which had to be answered. Should he fly
with her at once? This was not even to be thought
of.</p>

<p>Fly with her by-and-bye? He could not decide.</p>

<p>Leave her to the tender mercies&mdash;perhaps almost to
the brutality&mdash;of that other? Out of the question.</p>

<p>For the moment mere decency required him to quit
Suertebella, and withdraw to his own house, where he
might further consider what remained to be done. This
was the obvious thing; but even more obvious was it
not to abandon her who so valiantly tried to defend
herself. If there was danger for both of them at Suertebella
he could do no less than remain there in defiance
of the world’s opinion. The comments of others on
any business of his had become a matter of indifference
to him, and he decided to act on the dictates of his conscience,
and to defy the judgment of the multitude. By
remaining he might baffle the painful impression left
by the visits he would be forced to receive next
day from his friends and acquaintances&mdash;a crowd
anxious to offer condolences under any circumstances.
Everybody knew what was going on, and it was quite
certain that even his slightest acquaintance would come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
to see him here on the scene of his misfortune and of
this exciting piece of scandal. At first he thought he
would decline to receive any one; then he came to a
contrary conclusion. No, he would boldly face the intolerable
nuisance of curiosity and impertinence. Why
not? The social swarm, living on the sweets of their
own sins flavoured with the criticism of the sins of
other people&mdash;he could only despise and not fear
them. Besides all this, Don Pedro had begged him to
remain and lend his assistance in carrying out a beneficent
project which he was turning over in his mind,
and which was sure to turn out well though it was
neither a contract nor a loan.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />

VISITS OF CONDOLENCE.</h2>


<p class="mt3">Leon was awake and fighting his mental battle till
daybreak; then he felt very weary, and locking himself
into his room, he slept for some hours with that deep
sleep which is apt to visit the condemned wretch on
the last morning, a sort of intoxication produced by
violent and long-continued sorrow.</p>

<p>It was about ten o’clock when he called his servant
to help him dress, gaining much interesting information
meanwhile. The señora’s body had been carried
into the chapel by the kind permission of Don Pedro,
and Padre Paoletti had watched by it all night, and
would remain there all day and the night to come,
praying incessantly. Padre Paoletti, with the parish
priests of Polvoranca and the neighbouring village, had
performed Mass early that morning at the altar of St.
Luis Gonzaga.</p>

<p>Then Paoletti made his appearance to discuss
various pious legacies left by the deceased. To all this
Leon gave his most anxious attention, and he gave further
orders to the priest so that whatever remained to
be done might be carried out with all magnificence.
The marquis himself came in, and they sat talking for
a long time, without excitement or hard words, gloomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
and calm like a couple of diplomatic envoys from conquered
nations who in the midst of disaster are anxious
to checkmate a victorious usurper.</p>

<p>“It all rests with you,” said Don Pedro again and
again, with a melancholy expression. “You are master
of the situation.”</p>

<p>But even after these words the conversation continued
for some little time longer, growing more and
more grave and gloomy, till the last sentences sounded
almost like a funeral chant. The conference, like some
on which the fate of nations has turned, ended in a
breakfast. But on this occasion it was eaten in silence
and hardly touched, a thing which never happens in
politics.</p>

<p>In the afternoon visitors began to arrive. Leon saw
a melancholy procession of black coats and heard a
succession of sighs which announced the comers like
vocal visiting cards. Some with warm and genuine
sympathy, and others with total indifference, expressed
their sorrow at the event of the previous day; but
without mentioning what, thus offering an opportunity
for a satirical explanation. Some shook their heads,
expressing: “What a world we live in!” Others
squeezed his hand as much as to say: “You have lost
your wife! When shall I have such a piece of luck!”
Two hundred black-gloved hands pressed his in turn.
To him, feeling giddy and stunned and paying no attention
to their monotonous formulas, all they could
say sounded like a hiss and hum of irony. If the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Incroyables</i>
themselves had taken up their parable, speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
through the mass of neckcloth that almost covered
their mouths, it could not have produced a more discordant
mockery of woe. Some, of course, had come
out of sincere regard; some to witness this extraordinary
scene, this scandal above scandals; to look close
at the widower who, after killing his wife with neglect,
flaunted his connection with a married woman under
the very roof where the innocent victim had died only
a few hours since. This idea lurked perhaps in only a
few minds, but it did in some. After paying their
respects to the mourner, several went into the chapel to
gaze at the dead&mdash;beautiful even in death.</p>

<p>At last the dismal crowd grew thinner&mdash;only three
were left&mdash;two&mdash;one. He was one of Leon’s most
intimate friends and he stayed some time. Then Leon
was alone.</p>

<p>“Can I speak to you?” he heard a voice say at the
door and he started on seeing Gustavo.</p>

<p>“If you will speak briefly and plainly,” he replied.</p>

<p>His brother-in-law slowly approached.</p>

<p>“We are quitting this house,” he said, “which to us
is the abode of sorrow and sin. You, I presume, will
remain here, bound to it as you are by interest and
passion. We are glad to be free from you. My
mother desires me to beg that you will not attempt to
see her and take leave of her.”</p>

<p>“I had already made up my mind to forego that
honour,” said Leon coldly. “Pray be good enough to
make that clear to all your family.”</p>

<p>“Very good.&mdash;I can only congratulate myself on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
being the very opposite to you,” said the lawyer laying
his hand on his breast. “I answer your ironical philosophy
with Christian charity, and announce to you
that my mother, my father, all of us forgive you.”</p>

<p>“Thank them in my name. I am edified and delighted
by such Christian conduct.”</p>

<p>“We forgive you, not merely for the sad end....”</p>

<p>“What! again?”</p>

<p>“Not merely for the sad end to which you have
brought my sister, but for the insult you have offered to
her sainted remains.”</p>

<p>Leon sat silent, dignified and sad.</p>

<p>“Do you protest? Do you deny it?” said Gustavo.</p>

<p>“I deny nothing. I have the pleasure, on the contrary,
of leaving you undisturbed in the unenviable
enjoyment of your base imaginings.”</p>

<p>“Then we will drop this odious subject. We are
convinced, you are impenitent; each must hold his
own.&mdash;Before we part for ever I am anxious to have you
understand that I have done nothing to encourage
Cimarra, or to incite him to attack you. He came to
my house, and consulted me; I advised him and drew
up his case. All the rest is your own doing.”</p>

<p>“Be quite easy. Do not torment your conscience
about that man; while defending his lawful rights,
you may possibly guide him into the path of salvation.”</p>

<p>“Your atheistical mockery cannot disturb my conscience,
which, though it is far from spotless, at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
rate can see what is just and right. Whether Federico’s
repentance is sincere or not I cannot tell. But it is
against all sound doctrine to reject a man who confesses
his sins and declares he is resolved to act rightly for
the future. If he is brought to profess repentance, he
may be led to desire it; and the desire is half-way to
the accomplishment of the fact. In this respect this
man’s form of evil has an advantage over your hardened
disbelief, since you can never confess nor repent.”</p>

<p>“I do beg you,” said Leon “to spare me the
soporific treatment of your sermons. The strangest
thing about them is that they are in fact grossly heterodox.
A pretty apostle the Church can boast of!&mdash;Polito
might have come to announce the forgiveness of
the family, and he would not have preached to me.”</p>

<p>“He wished to come, but mamma would not allow
it. His impetuous nature fills her with alarm. We
all hope that as he is about to undertake the sobering
duties of married life he may settle down, and break
himself of the vices which scandalize us.”</p>

<p>“Leopold is going to be married? Allow me to
congratulate the lady, though I have not the pleasure
of knowing her.”</p>

<p>“The difficulties between my family and the Villa
Bojios were all removed last night when the young
lady’s mother came to call and was most lavish in her
affectionate condolences. The Villa Bojios have lately
lost a son, and the mothers mingled their tears; it was agreed
that Leopold and Susana should be married as
soon as we are out of mourning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Congratulate your mother for me&mdash;I wish her
every success.”</p>

<p>“The covert satire of your tone is worthy of your
utter disregard of our sorrow.&mdash;I have had nothing
whatever to do with this business, and you yourself know
very well that I have bewailed from my heart all the
disgrace which has fallen on the family in consequence
of my father’s misdemeanours, my mother’s folly and
Polito’s vices. You, when I believed you to be honest
and honourable, were the confidant of my griefs. Now,
when we recoil from you with invincible repugnance, I
feel I must tell you that I cannot eat a morsel of bread
in peace until we have repaid to the uttermost farthing
a man who does not deserve to be our creditor.”</p>

<p>“If you mean me, I look for no indemnification.
I am sufficiently repaid with ingratitude.”</p>

<p>“That is all very fine,” said Gustavo sarcastically.
“What I have said I have said. Now, we meet no
more. My last word is to acknowledge that I was mistaken
in saying that you would die of rage: You will
live on cynicism.&mdash;I know, the carriage is waiting and
the trunks packed for a theatrical flight in defiance of
social decency and the laws of morality. Well, well;
it is no more than might be expected of you.&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon
voyage</i>, son of Satan....”</p>

<p>“Your penetration and information as to my proceedings
are really remarkable!&mdash;Now, if you please
we will part.”</p>

<p>“It is my desire.”</p>

<p>“And I insist upon it. Good-bye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long after, peeping through the blinds, he
watched the departure of what had been his family.
The marquis, feeble and crushed, was almost carried by
the poet who was still in attendance. His wife, really
broken-hearted, was a pathetic object. Polito, his
throat muffled up in voluminous wraps, gave one
arm to the young lady who was to be his wife, while
in the other he held a dog. Milagros was supported
and almost lifted into the carriage by Pilar and Señora
de Villa Bojío.&mdash;Whips cracked, the horses pawed,
and one, two, three, four coaches rolled across the park
bearing away the dozen or so of human creatures, to
whom the solemnity of a recent sorrow lent factitious
respectability.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

THE VICTIMIZED HUSBAND.</h2>


<p class="mt3">As evening drew on Leon went into the room
where his wife had died. There were a variety of objects
left there which he wished to collect and remove.
The house was deserted; he could hear the echo of his
own steps, and the few lights cast deep shadows. He
thought he perceived a figure coming in from the portico
to the principal corridor, walking stealthily and
softly like a thief, listening to every sound and keeping
a sharp look-out. The first flash of suspicion followed
by a noiseless explosion of hatred, as the shot follows
the match, so startled Leon that his immediate impulse
was to hide himself, and watch the intruder unseen.
He shrunk behind a hanging and saw him creep by:
It was He. Leon perceived it more from an instinctive
loathing than by seeing him; just as, in a different
sense, a spirit of divination is born of lofty and passionate
love.</p>

<p>Cimarra passed him with a cat-like step, prying about
cautiously as he went. He turned down a carpeted
gallery where the walls were covered with a valuable
collection of political caricatures from the comic papers
and broadsheets of every country, displayed in a chronological
series&mdash;the history of a century in mockery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
and laughter. In the corners were four old-fashioned
screens covered with water-colours for which there had
been no room on the walls. Leon slipped behind the
nearest and watched the intruder, who sat down on a
large divan in the middle. To account for what followed
it is necessary to explain that, on arriving at
Suertebella, the new-comer had held a colloquy with
one of the under-servants on whom he could depend.</p>

<p>“Be so good,” he said, “as to go to the chapel and
say to Padre Paoletti that I have come here to speak
with he knows whom; and that I will wait for him in
the gallery of caricatures. Show him the way up the
stairs to the tribune, across the old picture-room, and
down the little passage.”</p>

<p>Soon Leon heard the familiar leaden shuffle. The
door of the little passage opened and the priest came
in. Leon could see him perfectly, because the gallery
had glass doors to the entrance hall which was always
brilliantly lighted up at night.</p>

<p>Cimarra hastened forward to meet the confessor;
they sat down side by side.</p>

<p>“Your respected uncles,” the priest began, “sent
me word last evening that you wished to speak with
me; but I did not suppose that it would be to-night,
or in this house, but later, and in the confessional.”</p>

<p>“I have things to discuss with you later and in the
confessional,” replied the other. “But you understand
that here, and to-night, I have something else to talk
about. That is to say, dear Señor Paoletti, that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
are two subjects to be discussed&mdash;one of considerable
interest, and the other very urgent.”</p>

<p>“Then begin with what is urgent, and leave what
is merely interesting till a future opportunity.”</p>

<p>“To begin with what is urgent&mdash;I take it for
granted that you know all the secrets of this house; I
do not of course mean the secrets of the confessional.”</p>

<p>“I know none whatever,” said the priest drily.</p>

<p>“That merely means that I have no claim on your
confidence. But, in short, do you not know what my
wife proposes to do? I hear she intends to fly with
her lover.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Paoletti sternly, “I know nothing whatever
of what you expect me to tell you; I never intrude
where I am not invited, and it is a matter of perfect
indifference to me whether the guilty persons
escape or no. I am here to watch and pray by the
body of a sainted daughter and friend, whose spiritual
director I had the honour to be.”</p>

<p>“I know it.&mdash;But you are respected and esteemed
by all. Don Pedro highly appreciates you; my wife is
very religious, and when she is in trouble she likes to
talk about the Virgin <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">del Cármen</i>, and the saints. It
might have happened that she should have sent for
you to console and strengthen her this morning, and
this evening you might&mdash;how can I tell? You might
have known things of which I am ignorant, and you
might&mdash;you might, just possibly, have been able and
willing to give me some information and extricate me
from my position of uncertainty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know nothing; nor, if I did, could I lower myself
to play the part of the spy and tale-bearer, which
you seem to expect,” exclaimed Paoletti rather hotly.
“You do not know me; your worthy uncles have failed
to explain to you the sort of man I am. My office is
to console the afflicted and reprove the erring; I have
no concern with worldly affairs. Those who need me
will find me nowhere but in the confessional. Good-night,
Caballero.”</p>

<p>He rose to go. Cimarra detained him, holding his
robe.</p>

<p>“But I have much to explain to you,” he said.
“Do not judge me so hastily. If I were to confess, if
I were....”</p>

<p>The priest sat down again.</p>

<p>“No, I cannot confess here and now. To you it
would be an act of sheer hypocrisy. Such a farce
would ill-beseem me. I wish to speak the truth, even
though the truth that comes from my lips should deal
ruin and terror like ball from a cannon. Allow me, in
the first place, to tell you something about myself, that
you may the better understand the urgency of my
claims.</p>

<p>“I must begin by saying that I always was fully
conscious of my own slender merit, and that the moral
world was to me a citadel with closed and barred gates.
I never had any wish to expose myself to the labour of
besieging the citadel or scaling its walls. It was my
fortune&mdash;or misfortune, which, it is hard to decide&mdash;not
to believe in God or in anything beyond this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
atrocious barred dungeon in which we are confined;
and with this comfortable lack of creed I enjoyed a
tranquil frame of mind which lulled my spirit to lethargy
and enabled me to remain supremely indifferent to the
good or bad opinion of others.”</p>

<p>The priest, really horrified at hearing such an appalling
profession of faith, again turned to go, saying
that he was open to confession, but did not profess to
tame monsters; but Federico only smiled, and detaining
the Italian he went on:</p>

<p>“But stay. I have something to say that may perhaps
please you better.&mdash;I am weary of it all. I have
been rich, and poor; powerful, and a beggar; I have
seen all that is to be seen and enjoyed all that is to be
enjoyed. With regard to women, I may say that on the
whole I despise them; and I have no belief in anybody’s
virtue. If you ask my opinion of men I can
only say with the sceptical poet: ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Plus je connais les
hommes plus j’aime les chiens.</i>’”<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>


<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<span class="label"><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1">[A]</a></span> The better I know men, the better I love dogs.
</div></div>

<p>“Allow me to advise you to go and live in the company
of dogs, or to found a canine colony where you
will feel more at your ease,” said Paoletti with grim
irony. “I am only waiting to see if any spark of light
will flash from the horrible blackness of your soul.
But I see none.”</p>

<p>“I am coming to a delicate point. You know all
about my wife.&mdash;When I was supposed to be dead she
fell in love with another man. I believe she had loved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>him long before. Pepa hated me from the day she
married me. In point of fact I did everything to
justify her hatred. I treated her ill, I degraded her, I
compromised her again and again by my pecuniary
delinquencies; I spent her money on other women;
my language was not refined, any more than my
behaviour; I looked upon her as a useful piece of
property, neither more nor less.”</p>

<p>“Enough of this!” exclaimed the priest, starting
away from him as though he were some loathesome
vermin. “If this is a confession of sin I will listen to
it; but if it is merely an outrageous display of hardened
cynicism I cannot&mdash;I cannot bear it.”</p>

<p>“You have interrupted me at the most important
point. I was just going to say that now my wife to a certain
extent commands my respect; that I acknowledge
myself guilty towards her, and in every way her inferior,
that I deserve her contempt; that it is only
natural, and even legitimate in theory&mdash;I may warn
you that I too have theories&mdash;and I admit that,
in theory, it is only natural that Pepa should love another
man: as natural as that the birds should build
their nests in the branches of trees rather than in the
jaws of foxes.”</p>

<p>“It never can be natural and legitimate for a married
woman to love any man but her husband,” said
Paoletti very gravely. “What would have been
natural and legitimate is that your wife, instead of listening
to the addresses of a married man and contributing
to the martyrdom of a perfect angel, should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
dedicated to God the affections you have ceased to deserve.”</p>

<p>“Mysticism is a figurative fount which cannot satisfy
the thirsty. She did not crave to love a phantom but
a man. I have reasons for believing that she has
loved him from her childhood. In one of our violent
quarrels, which used to be of daily occurrence, she
said: ‘You are not my husband and never have been;
my husband is there....’ and she tapped her forehead.
Another time she said: ‘Marrying you was a deliberate
act of self-degradation.’ In short, respected father,
at this moment I confess to a grain of respect for the
wretched soul who has been my victim. As a woman
I do not care a straw for her. She does not
appeal to my heart, to my imagination, or to my senses.
So far as love goes, I could almost let her go, let her
break one tie to form the other; but my pride rebels.
Another thing I may tell you is that I hate the man; I
have hated him ever since we were at college together;
I believe that my aversion and her love have run in
parallel grooves till an unlucky moment when they
came into collision, and broke out in conflict,&mdash;and I
must conquer&mdash;I must conquer.”</p>

<p>“You have only to assert your rights. But this is
no concern of mine; I plead not for law but for virtue.”</p>

<p>“I am coming to that point. We have here an alliance
of virtue and law, and both are on my side,”
Cimarra went on with increased vehemence. “I am
the stronger and she the weaker party; I am the defendant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
and they are the criminals. I am protected
alike by religion and morality; by God and his laws,
by the Church and by public opinion. Nothing, no
one, can protect them. The ground on which I stand
is solid earth, the best suited to my purposes, desiring
as I do to be reconciled to the powers that rule the
world, and to become a useful wheel in the social
machine. Feeling secure in my position, and upheld
both by human Justice, and by what you call divine
laws, I intended to prosecute them on legal grounds, to
exhaust every means, to worry them out of their lives
and give them no peace nor breathing time; to cover
them with dishonour, heap disgrace on them ... to attack
them with the code in one hand and the anathemas
of the Church in the other. These were my
weapons; but, you must know, that my worthy uncles
and my respected father-in-law have spent this whole
day in concocting a compromise. Oh! my illustrious
father-in-law is an eminently practical man, with an intense
horror of exaggeration. He is as fond of me as
he might be of the toothache. Unfortunately for him,
this man, who is all-powerful in society, and who has
a right to treat Spaniards as if they were slaves he had
bought or could sell, can do nothing to hurt me. The
arm of the law, if he used it to attack me, would turn
and wound him too.”</p>

<p>“And you say that Don Justo Cimarra and Don
Pedro Fúcar have been planning a compromise?” said
Paoletti, who, in spite of his resolution, was yielding a
little to curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>“An amicable separation.&mdash;But as yet there is
nothing proved, my dear sir. All must depend on our
philosopher, geologist, cave-hunter.&mdash;Gustavo told me
that everything was prepared for their flight, and I believe
him&mdash;I must confess that I should do the same
in their place!”</p>

<p>“So far as I am concerned I can only say that the
matter does not interest me in the least,” said Paoletti,
subduing his curiosity. “You are talking of law-suits,
not of a case of conscience.”</p>

<p>“I will go on to speak of my wife. You know that
I have a daughter?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and again the priest felt the prick of curiosity.</p>

<p>“Monina is my child. Well, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor cura</i>, the only
being in the world who can rouse my soul to anything
like an emotion, the only creature who, now and then,
makes me think and feel unlike my habitual self, for
whom a smile still lingers in that dark, unfathomed region
which we call the soul&mdash;for lack of any other
name, is my little daughter. I do not know what
comes over me; when I was at the point of death in
that horrible ship with its cargo of petroleum, everything
vanished from my mind but the sense of danger, and
in the midst of that danger that little golden head rose
up before my eyes. I fancied that I clung to it to save
myself in that wretched leaky boat which seemed every
moment to be sinking. You will smile at my folly.&mdash;I
used to play with her, to make her laugh that I might
laugh too....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>“At last, at last,” said Paoletti with satisfaction.
“Here is the spark I was looking for.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;do not suppose there is any particular virtue
in it; it is only that my little fair-haired child&mdash;or
toy&mdash;with her angel’s eyes, has a wonderful charm for
me. I fancy I love her, and should love her more if I
had her more constantly with me. I hear she was near
dying of croup. I long to have her in my arms.
What do you say to this?”</p>

<p>“I say that there is no soil, however barren, from
which no flower can spring.”</p>

<p>“This has nothing to do with flowers.&mdash;What I
want to tell you is that as I passed through New York,
I saw, in a shop window, a little toy carriage full of
dolls and pulled by a string, and I bought it to bring
to her.”</p>

<p>Paoletti smiled.</p>

<p>“I see all your pride, your indifference to your
wife, your hatred of your rival, the law-suit and possible
compromise; I see your atrocious atheism, your passions,
your inhuman cynicism,&mdash;your love for the
child, and the little carriage pulled by a string,”&mdash;Cimarra
had it in his hand.&mdash;“But I do not see what
I can do in the matter.”</p>

<p>“Now we have come to the point, to what, as I
said, is urgent. I am most anxious to know what they
are plotting.&mdash;Is he here to-night? I was told he
had some friends to see him. I am perfectly convinced
that you know it; my wife is sure to have told
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>“To have told me? I believe the lady has a particular
dislike to me.”</p>

<p>“You must know through the Condesa de Vera,
who is my wife’s most intimate friend; she, if I mistake
not, is one of your flock.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing, and they have told me nothing,”
said the priest with some asperity. “And even if I
knew....”</p>

<p>“Oh! you need not be afraid that in case of their
attempting to fly, I should go in for high tragedy, and
make a scene. I do not challenge or kill. I am more
philosophical than all your philosophers put together.”</p>

<p>“I can only repeat that I know nothing and want
to know nothing.”</p>

<p>“It is impossible that such a man as you should
have come to the house two days in succession and not
know everything that goes on in it.”</p>

<p>“But I am not a friend in this house&mdash;I am a foe.”</p>

<p>“Then as you cannot satisfy my curiosity,” said
the intruder sadly, “you cannot help me I suppose?”</p>

<p>“In what?”</p>

<p>“To see the child.”</p>

<p>“It is vain to ask me a favour which is altogether
out of my sphere. Nothing on earth would induce me
to take a step beyond this room. Apply to the servants.”</p>

<p>“No one will do a thing for me for fear of Fúcar.
My affectionate father-in-law has given strict orders
that I am not to be admitted. All the way from the
gate I only found one servant who would take a bribe.
Even the dogs hate me here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Steal in like a thief.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid of being seen.”</p>

<p>“Go in as a father.”</p>

<p>“I cannot, at any rate at this hour.”</p>

<p>“Much less can I.”</p>

<p>“If the Countess de Vera is here and you say only
two words to her&mdash;if you only tell her with your usual
eloquence what I want, what I wish&mdash;she will not refuse
you. I solemnly swear to you that I have no evil
intention whatever. I only want to give my child
three good kisses....”</p>

<p>“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vade retro.</i> I do not trust your intentions which
may be what you describe them, or may be utterly
vile.”</p>

<p>“I will not insist. At any rate I have the grace
not to be an obstinate beggar.&mdash;The only important
subject of our interview may be regarded as disposed
of. You will forgive my boldness.”</p>

<p>“It is forgiven.”</p>

<p>“The other question of interest which I proposed
to discuss with you, and which can be postponed, is
closely connected with what I have been saying. Supposing
my wife is subdued by the threat of the law, controls
her passion and sends the geologist about his
business.... In a short time it will be quite easy for
you to become Pepa’s spiritual director.”</p>

<p>“I do not go where I am not bidden.”</p>

<p>“Pepa has many friends who are your daughters in
the Church, who form, if I may say so, your spiritual
family. The Condesa de Vera in particular....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I am her director; she honours me by her
friendship.”</p>

<p>“Just so. Then if you chose you could be Pepa’s.
Her lonely life would predispose her to mysticism.
The mind of a poor weak woman, when her illusions
are past, turns to the altar.”</p>

<p>”Well, you may have a really good and honest purpose
in suggesting this. If what you desire is that I
should interfere to make the best of an unhappy marriage,
and snatch back to God two souls that the Devil
claims, the idea seems to me a good one. But to that
end, you must begin by abjuring your atrocious opinions,
and become a sincere Catholic.”</p>

<p>“So far as that goes, I have no wish to disturb the
general concord. I am most anxious to be reconciled
to society, to show my respect for its venerable institutions,
to settle down and give rise to no scandals, above
all not to set a bad example to the lower orders, who,
if they see a man in broad-cloth neglect going to
church, think that they may commit robbery and murder.
I have no intention of starting afresh with a map
in my hand, or of toiling in business to accumulate a
fortune for myself. I am sure that I shall get on and
that even Fúcar, who thinks himself a little Almighty,
will cease to call me a ruffian and even agree at last to
make bargains and do business with me. The present
generation has a powerful gift of forgetfulness. It is
very easy to rehabilitate oneself in a society like ours, a
medley of the most dissimilar elements&mdash;all bad, and
governed by the worst&mdash;the love of show. In quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
half of the households of a certain class we see the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage à trois</i>; public administration ought to be
called public prevarication; high and low are distinguished
by nothing on earth but the different clothes
under which they hide their grossly scandalous conduct;
politics are a system of pillage; the people are
ruined in taxes and enrich themselves by lotteries; justice
is the curse of fools and the blessing of the knowing;
and if two or three agree to call some puppet a
remarkable man, every one believes them. Nothing is
easier than to make a robe of honour and put it on, to
become a distinguished patriot and public character,
and see your portrait on the penny match-boxes. I
would undertake, if I gave my mind to it, to make
people think I was worthy to be canonized within a
couple of years. But I am not prepared to turn bigot
just yet.&mdash;As to our marriage do not worry yourself
with trying to patch that up&mdash;it is past remedy; but
if she, from an honest instinct, packs off her lover, then
make a saint of her, and you will comfort her greatly.
I should be glad to see my wife devout, pious and
good; I like your edifying folks. Leave me to recover
my own footing in society in my own way. What I
ask of your goodness and Catholic feeling is that, after
you have gained the control of Pepa’s mind&mdash;without
any idea of bringing us together, for which I do not
care in the least&mdash;you will induce her to allow me to
see the child. There would be no need for my coming
here; I would rather not, I have always hated Suertebella;
but some one could bring her to see me&mdash;you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
for instance. Let us say she should come and dine
with me twice a week, or once a week: nothing more
than that.”</p>

<p>“What depths of utter apathy!” exclaimed Paoletti
with intense bitterness. “I have seen many men of such
temper in society in Spain; but you, with your detestable
pessimism, could give them points and beat them
all.”</p>

<p>“I at any rate say what I mean.”</p>

<p>“The long and short of it is, Señor Cimarra, that
you are in my eyes so abominable that I cannot see
my way to gratifying the only legitimate desire which
lurks, almost invisible, in the blackness and barrenness
of your soul. Do not count upon me for anything. If
your wife repents and dismisses her lover, and if I am
called in&mdash;which is no doubt, very possible&mdash;to direct
her conscience, my first task will be to cure her of her
sinful griefs; and then I will turn her thoughts to God,
who is the only refuge of those poor women who have
been so rash as to love unworthy men. What joy for
me to win a fresh battle against Satan. You&mdash;you do
not exist, you are nothing to me! Do not keep me
any longer; let me return to watch by the beloved
dead.”</p>

<p>“I shall not go into the chapel; I have a horror of
dead people. Pardon me for having disturbed you,
reverend Father.”</p>

<p>“I will not neglect to pray for you.”</p>

<p>“I do not refuse&mdash;on the contrary, I thank you.”</p>

<p>“I look forward to the day of your repentance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you; you are most kind. It is more than
I deserve. Good-bye, a thousand apologies.”</p>

<p>The little priest went softly away; his heavy steps
died away in the passage which led to the chapel.
Cimarra went out the same way; but he went down
the steps and not into the little sanctuary where the illumination
of mortuary torches filled him with more
dread than respect. He crossed the deserted park,
shrinking into the shadow of the trees when, now and
again, he heard footsteps. Every now and then he felt
his pocket to be sure that he had not lost the toy for
Monina.</p>

<p>Presently, in the course of his nocturnal expedition,
he saw Fúcar’s carriage drive in at the gates, and from
his safe distance he addressed him in thought rather
than in words: “Ah! my friend, what eyes I caught
you making this afternoon in the street at the fair
American who came with me from the States. Jupiter!
you wished she was for you I’ll wager.”</p>

<p>He saw the marquis get out of the carriage with
another man, and muttered to himself: “My uncle is
with him! What is up I wonder. Oh! dread curiosity!
Why do you torment me as if you were jealousy?”</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

THREE AGAINST TWO.</h2>


<p class="mt3">The next evening, at the hour fixed by Don Pedro,
Leon made his way to Pepa’s sitting-room. She was
there with her father and a third person. Monina,
who had been dancing and skipping round her mother,
was condemned to retire to bed; a banishment involving
floods of tears, but against which there is no appeal
for the little ones when their elders have business
to discuss. The marquis half-buried in a deep arm-chair,
with his fat chin resting on his shirt front, his lips
sticking out as if too much flesh had gone to the making
of his face, his brows knit under a labyrinth of
wrinkles&mdash;the scars, as it were, won in a hundred
fights against “all exaggeration,” was an impressive
personage. The third of the trio was an old man with
white hair, a dry thin face, and excessively short-sighted,
to judge from the strong concavity of his gold-mounted
spectacles which were astride on a nose that,
for size and curve, was more like a pelican’s bill than
anything else in creation. His manners had the gravity
of a student mixed with the patriarchal frankness of a
man of good birth. They were all in mourning, and
the grief of Pepa’s heart overflowed her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here he is,” said Don Pedro taking his daughter’s
hand caressingly.</p>

<p>“So I see,” said Pepa looking up at Leon and
then looking away. “And now he is to repeat what
my father told me, and I would not believe.”</p>

<p>“My dearest child,” said Fúcar, “this is a case of
honour, of duty, of social decency, of morality&mdash;both
in the true and in the more customary sense. Consider.&mdash;You
cannot have everything you want.”</p>

<p>“I know it, I know it,” murmured Pepa, fixing a
stony gaze on the table-cloth before her.</p>

<p>“Much as it costs me,” said Leon feeling that
brevity was most to the purpose. “I must declare that
I see it to be an inexorable duty to part from the
woman I love, and give up every hope of ever making
her mine.”</p>

<p>No one said a word in reply. Pepa let her head
drop on her father’s shoulder and closed her eyes.
Leon took one of her hands, which she passively surrendered,
and said with much feeling:</p>

<p>“It is the greatness of a crisis that tests greatness
of soul.”</p>

<p>Again there was a pause; then Don Pedro, swallowing
half his words and twisting his mouth nervously,
began as follows:</p>

<p>“And I declare that we have come to this peaceable
and happy compromise on the strength of an agreement
concluded between Don Justo Cimarra and
myself, by which my respected friend undertakes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
his nephew will withdraw his action....” Don Pedro
fairly choked. Don Justo came to the rescue.</p>

<p>“And renounce the rights he might legally assert.”</p>

<p>“Just so, he renounces all use of the weapon that
the law places within his reach, on condition that he,
who by every theory of law, morality, and religion is
out of place in this miserable conjunction of three persons
where there should be but two, shall disappear
completely.&mdash;My dear friend,” he went on, turning to
Leon with a conciliatory smile, “you, by retiring from
a position untenable by law and morality&mdash;impossible,
in fact, but for the corruption and laxity of modern
society&mdash;you have saved us from a disgraceful scandal.
I can only thank you with all my heart, and....”</p>

<p>Again Don Pedro cast an appealing glance at his
friend.</p>

<p>“The circumstances of the case,” Don Justo went
on emphasizing his speech with his forefinger, “are exceptional.
For my part, I am thankful that the quarrel
should be made up. I was the first to advise my
nephew to withdraw from it, if we could only insure
the permanent absence of this gentleman...” and the
finger pointed at Leon. “But as the circumstances of
the case are so exceptional&mdash;I must repeat it&mdash;and as
the very small moral worth of my nephew himself
would seem to justify that rebellion against his authority
which we are anxious to avert...” and the finger
pointed in mute accusation to Pepa. “I was, as I say,
the first to advise the concessions demanded by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
gentleman...” again the finger indicated Leon, “and
which, I admit, are quite in the spirit of true judicial
prudence. In view, then, of all these facts I thought it
well to draw up in concert with my friend here...” the
finger after wavering like the needle of a compass turned
to the marquis&mdash;“the articles of an honourable peace,
I pledged my word of honour that my nephew should
accept the condition proposed by Señor Don Leon and
fulfil his part of the compact.”</p>

<p>The worthy gentleman, who paused now and then
in his speech to give it greater emphasis, here stopped
for a moment, and then went on:</p>

<p>“The condition laid down by this gentleman, and
agreed to, by proxy, by what I am obliged to term the
innocent party&mdash;in the eyes of the law&mdash;is that this
lady shall live with her father and her daughter, here
at Suertebella; and that my nephew shall never, under
any pretence, cross the boundary line of the estate, thus
effecting a separation which, without being hostile,
shall be absolute and complete.”</p>

<p>“And everything has been settled in a satisfactory
manner,” said Don Pedro, relaxing his frown and stroking
his daughter’s hair with his heavy hand, while she
said not a word, and did not even open her eyes.
“Time, time,” he said, “time is the remedy for all
things.&mdash;Do you not think so, Leon?”</p>

<p>“I, for my part,” said Leon, “do not expect time
to give me what it has not got to bestow. I hate to
forget&mdash;it is the death of the heart. My feelings will
be the same that they are now to my dying day&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
at a distance, where I can never be troubled by a
wretch whom I have always despised, and always shall
despise. I have spent my life in the pursuit of an
ideal&mdash;the ideal Christian family: the centre of peace
and corner-stone of virtue; the stepping-stone to moral
perfection; the fount in which each and all may be
baptised and purified. Such a home is an education;
it compels us to grow to a higher standard and rubs off
the asperities of our nature, giving us the most precious
lessons by placing in our care the men of the future,
that we may train them from the cradle to years of discretion.&mdash;And
all this has been, and must ever be,
to me no more than a dream. Two women have
crossed my path, Religion gave me the first, and religion,
wrongly understood, tore her from me. The
second would have given me herself&mdash;gave me her
heart and soul; and I took the gift; but the law deprives
me of it, and I have no choice but to resign it.
All my attempts to achieve the lovely reality will be no
less ill-fated. Society threw this woman into the arms
of another man, and if I claim her I condemn her and
myself to a life of unqualified disgrace, on a level with
the basest of those I most abhor. Nay, and our dishonour
becomes a legacy to innocent creatures, guiltless
of the errors committed before they were born, but
nevertheless coming nameless and dishonoured into the
world.”</p>

<p>He kissed Pepa’s hand which she had left in his,
and then went on:</p>

<p>“The presence of these two persons, who will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
scandalized, no doubt, by my words, shall not prevent
my expressing my feelings.&mdash;To me, this woman is
mine, mine by the divine law of love. I, radical as I
am, bow to this law of the heart; but when I wish to
put these anarchical views into practice, I tremble and
dare not. The fierce rebellion lingers in my soul and
cannot venture forth. Those who cannot transform
the world and uproot its errors, must respect them.
Those who cannot see the mysterious limit-line between
legality and iniquity, must yield to the law with the
patience of slaves. Those whose souls rise with cries
and struggles in a revolt which seems legitimate, are
nevertheless incompetent to place a sounder constitution
in the place of that which crushes them, and can
only suffer in silence.”</p>

<p>“We are all slaves to the laws of the age we live
in,” said Don Justo sternly.</p>

<p>“That is true,” Leon said; he was evidently speaking
for Pepa’s benefit alone. “Our spirits are but a
part of the spirit that made those laws; we are so far
responsible for their defects that we must accept the
consequences. If every one who felt injured by the
machine in which we move&mdash;the majority in lazy indifference&mdash;if
the sufferers, I say, were to set to work
to alter it and could not repair it, what a world this
would become! We must submit to be torn and mangled,
secretly bewailing our misery, and only wishing
we could live to see new machinery at work. But even
that, I have no doubt, would hurt some one, since
every improvement in one phase of human life brings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
some fresh form of suffering. Life is an aspiration&mdash;a
thirst which revives as soon as it is quenched. If
we could conceive of immortality under no other aspect,
we could imagine it as consisting in seeing ourselves
constantly under the dominion of&mdash;whether in
small actions or in great ones&mdash;and constantly enchanted
by the lovely vision of that distant horizon
we call perfection.&mdash;If you, poor soul, could only
know how I have fought with myself since we last
talked together. I reconsidered every impossible
alternative. It would be so easy to escape from this
maze by simply following the impulse of my heart,
and shielding myself behind theoretical and selfish arguments
which no one but myself could follow and
which even I could not distinctly marshall.&mdash;You
were ready to come, the carriage was waiting, all the
means of flight were ready, there was not an obstacle
in sight and we could have afforded to think lightly of
the opinion of society.&mdash;To be off and happy in some
distant land! How easy and pleasant it seemed! You&mdash;not
my wife&mdash;I your lover; both living in the practice
of social anarchy, our illicit connection an outrage
on the noblest and most necessary institution of human
society; I haunted by a ghost, and you by a living
man, who on every possible occasion would proclaim
and urge his rights; neither of us having any claims
against others while the whole world would have claims
against us. Your daughter, again, growing up with
this horrible example before her innocent eyes; and on
what moral ground could you damn me if one day she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
felt inclined to become the mistress of the first man who
fell in love with her? When once we break the
bounds, we have no choice but to cast off all the ties
that give order and stability to the world.&mdash;Yes, I
thought over everything that could be said on either
side. Then I considered whether I could not stay
here, and soothe my anxieties with the satisfaction of
being near you, even though I should neither see you
nor speak to you. But that again cannot be. If I
stay within reach of you, some time or other, almost
without intending it, we should be certain to meet.
Then that man I loathe would interfere&mdash;I should be
unable to control my hatred, and I know, I feel, it
would end in bloodshed. If I do not go away&mdash;far
away, and soon&mdash;I know how that baleful impulse
would grow stronger in me; it is like some hideous bidding
to kill. Under my calmer reason turbid springs
seethe in my soul, surging up to sweep away every obstacle.
There is that within me which urges me to
violence and rebellion; but I lack courage, for I reflect
that nothing permanent, right, or moral, can be built
up on anarchy or on blood. I take refuge in my conscience,
and I have decided to go. I go to save your
honour and the happiness of your child.”</p>

<p>Pepa did not lift her head nor open her eyes and
she spoke with bitter despair.</p>

<p>“I am incapable of argument; I seek one, but in
vain; I look into my soul and I find nothing but
love.”</p>

<p>Then she slowly raised herself and opened her hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
and aching eyes; but she looked at no one as she
added:</p>

<p>“I am punished. When I see that the fetters which
link me to a villain cannot be broken, I cannot help remembering
that the fault is all my own.&mdash;Yes, mine;
for in a fit of jealous pique I bound myself for life to a
worthless wretch. I flung myself into evil; degrading
myself and my father, and turning marriage into a
wicked and hideous farce.&mdash;Why had I no patience?
I rushed into marriage with a strange impulse towards
martyrdom. It was the mad vanity of anguish which
seeks to add to its tortures.&mdash;Then, when you thought
I was free, why did you seek me? We both made a
cruel mistake in binding ourselves with intolerable
bonds. As soon as you were free, I was suddenly
caught again, and in that fatal pillory; but I hoped
some chivalrous hand might dash it to pieces.”</p>

<p>“There was no way but bloodshed,” Leon said
hastily.</p>

<p>Pepa made no answer.</p>

<p>“I am the victim,” she exclaimed after a painful
silence. “And I cannot bear to die&mdash;it is grief and
punishment. I hate to be sacrificed; it is misery, utter
misery, even if it is right and just&mdash;even if I deserve
it. Here, before me, I see two respectable men&mdash;my
father and a judge. Well, before them, and before you.&mdash;The
man I claim....” And she fixed her eyes on
Leon’s with an indescribable expression of love and reproach;
she gasped for air and hardly seemed to have
breath enough to speak: “You are mine&mdash;and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
you all three I declare that this desertion...” she burst
into tears and added feebly: “is cowardly.”</p>

<p>Don Justo lifted up his calm persuasive voice.</p>

<p>“Try,” he said, “to see the immediate details in
their true proportions, and fix your thoughts on broad
and eternal facts. The soul may grow to the dignity
of its sorrows and borrow from them a sort of majesty
to rule the spirit.”</p>

<p>“True,” said Leon sadly. “Our very wounds reveal
a secret and ineffable fount of compensation.
Pepa&mdash;my darling, my heart’s wife&mdash;wife, I say, by
an unwritten law on which we may not act, which can
never be of any avail; but which lurks in my soul
like the germ of truth, a holy seed buried in the depths
of being.&mdash;Look into your soul and you will see yourself
nobler and more worthy in your sorrow than in the
satisfaction of your passion. Though we are conquered
and humiliated by the crushing necessity that parts us&mdash;a
mysterious mixture of something dignified and
venerable with iniquity and injustice, a horrible and unnatural
coalition, we may enjoy the noblest form of triumph.
You are religious; and I believe in the
immortality of the soul, in eternal justice, in final perfection:
a brief creed but a grand and firm one. We
are conquered; we are victims and martyrs. But Hope
has no limits. It is a grace which links us to the unknown
and calls to us from afar, beautifying life and
giving us strength to stand firm and walk onward. We
will not be so criminal as to cut the thread which
guides us forward to a goal which, though remote, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
not invisible to eyes that are not bound by an evil conscience.
Conquer despair, rise superior to it; resign
yourself, and hope.”</p>

<p>“Hope? Have I not said that I should die hoping?”
said Pepa bitterly, recurring to an old idea. “It
is my punishment; my heart told me long since that its
name was Hope. And if I die?”</p>

<p>“It matters not.”</p>

<p>“It matters not?” she said, for Leon’s fervent spirituality
did not meet her mood. He would have said
more, but he was at an end of his arguments, and the
suggestions of consolation and hope with which he
tried to do battle were, he saw, of no more avail than
weapons which break in the hand in the heat of a fray.
He knew not what to say. Feeling, which can sometimes
be quelled by reason, and which he had studiously
endeavoured to subdue and control, rose in revolt,
snatched up its despotic sceptre and asserted its
dominion. He rose.</p>

<p>“Now&mdash;so soon?” said Pepa rushing into his
arms with a sudden overflow of passion.</p>

<p>”Heaven forgive me!” cried Leon choked with
emotion. “With my wretched arguments, I am belabouring
myself with my own logic. It is a horrible
farce a mockery of morality and cannot bind me.”</p>

<p>Pepa clasped her hands as if in prayer and preparing
for death, and Leon was on the point of uttering
some wildly subversive ideas which came boiling from
his heart like the lava from a volcano, when the maid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
rushed in who had charge of Monina. She was pale
and trembling.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” said the marquis.</p>

<p>“The man&mdash;there!”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“A man. He came in suddenly&mdash;he is kissing the
child.”</p>

<p>“It is he!” exclaimed Fúcar much agitated.</p>

<p>“He!”</p>

<p>“But it was agreed that he was not to come!”</p>

<p>“He&mdash;he is here?” cried Leon suddenly losing
logic, reason, prudence and self-command, and flaring
up in frenzy. “Let him dare to come in! Does he
presume to desecrate these walls? I am glad to meet
him here&mdash;I will tear him limb from limb like a foul
beast!”</p>

<p>He turned to the door, where a man was standing.
Pepa, with a piercing shriek, fell senseless. Don Pedro
threw his strong arms round Leon to hold him back,
and the older gentleman rushed forward indignantly to
check his nephew’s further advance.</p>

<p>“For mercy’s sake!&mdash;in the name of all the
Saints!” exclaimed Don Pedro.</p>

<p>“Stand back!” said Don Justo. “Do not stir a
step forward.”</p>

<p>“What business have you here?” cried Leon with
contemptuous insolence.</p>

<p>“Go,” said the magistrate. “Have you forgotten
our agreement?”</p>

<p>“No. The agreement is not yet in force,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Cimarra, not moving an inch, and fixing his eyes on
Leon with the glare of a wild tiger. “I came to see
my little girl for the last time. I will not contravene
the compromise, if others adhere to it. I have no
desire to come here unless you are here.”</p>

<p>“I entreat you to go away,” said Don Pedro to
Federico.</p>

<p>“He must go first.”</p>

<p>But the gloomy, surly figure in the door-way made
no sign of moving.</p>

<p>“He must go first,” echoed Cimarra.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I first&mdash;wretch!&mdash;So it must be,” said
Leon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Don Pedro and a maid had lifted Pepa
and carried her to a sofa.</p>

<p>“You first,” Federico insisted, his cynicism yielding
for a moment to an impulse of real dignity. “If not,
I....”</p>

<p>“Nay; I will go first,” said Leon bitterly. “It is
but right.”</p>

<p>He went up to the senseless form lying pale and
dumb on the sofa, and gazed at her for a moment; he
looked up at Cimarra, and bending over Pepa, kissed
her cheek with tender passion. Then, fixing his eyes
on her husband, he said:</p>

<p>“Bully! Thus I take leave of the woman you claim
as your wife. If it is a crime, kill me; you have a right
to do so.&mdash;Have you a weapon?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Federico sullenly, and putting his hand
into his breast-pocket. It seemed as though a spark of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
honour, vigour and dignity had suddenly flashed into
being in this abject creature&mdash;a corpse returned from
the grave&mdash;as the will-o’-the-wisp suddenly flickers up
from a foul morass. He stood face to face with his foe,
a pistol in his hand, with a dull roar in his voice, and a
sinister light in his eye. Leon waited calmly. But
Don Pedro and his friend seized Federico and held his
arms. After a violent struggle, they succeeded in pulling
him back; Leon remained standing with his arms
folded, in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>“Leave the house!” cried Don Justo to his
nephew.</p>

<p>“I will answer for the other,” said Don Pedro.</p>

<p>Don Justo dragged Federico away, not allowing
him to pause an instant till he was fairly out of the
house.</p>

<p>Leon sadly but steadily quitted the room by the
other door. Fúcar accompanied him as far as the
Chinese room, where he left him, stretched like a lifeless
body on a divan.</p>

<p>“Go” he said, “leave us, and put an end to this
misery.” And he went back to his daughter.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br />

THE END.</h2>


<p class="mt3">Leon lay there a long time, unconscious of the flight
of time. His scattered faculties slowly recovered their
power of calmly contemplating the situation, though he
found no peace. He rose to leave the house, and
wandered vaguely from one room to another, seeking
his way to the hall. When at length he reached it, he
thought he heard strange voices, and stood still to
listen; then, turning away, he descended a flight of
back stairs that led to the basement floor, and tried to
find his way out into the garden. After going in and
out for some time in the endless and tortuous corridors
of the servant’s premises, he saw a door which he
opened.</p>

<p>All the blood in his body rushed in a cold tide to
his heart and gave him a shock like a sudden fall, as
he found himself in the chapel, lighted up by innumerable
flambeaux. He took off his hat and gazed with
open eyes. He was too much startled to do anything
for some time but stand motionless at the door; he
hardly seemed to breathe, and his bewildered mind was
aware only of a mountain of light, for so it appeared to
him: a mass of ruddy slender flames which stretched
their quivering tongues to the very roof, rising from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
melting wax that dropped in yellow streams. In the
midst, as a base to this blazing pyramid, a funereal object
filled, as it were the throne of honour; white
drapery and two marble hands were all that could be
distinguished.</p>

<p>It needed all his manly courage to carry him nearer.
Before stepping forward he glanced round him. No
one was there; he could not hear a sound, not even a
living breath, was audible; the cold remains of a human
being, robed in the garments of a saintly death,
seemed guarded by silence. The statue of a pallid
youth stood upon the altar; his eyes, painted like life,
shone across the chapel, to watch all who entered, and
say: “Beware! Touch her not!”</p>

<p>Leon advanced slowly, treading softly that he might
not hear the sound of his own steps. Reverence, the
sanctity of the spot, his agonising hesitancy between
the wish to approach and the instinct to withdraw,
caused him to go through half a dozen separate states
of mind in the course of the twenty steps between the
door and the altar: anxiety and curiosity, nay fear&mdash;or
superstition. He had time to assure himself that it
was awe that held him back, and the audacious curiosity
of that very awe which urged him forward.</p>

<p>He saw her. There she lay, before him, on the
ground, and at the very threshold, as it were, of the realm
where her immortal soul might find complete repose.
Her spirit, selfish rather than generous, had already
passed, with a sigh perhaps of surprise and awe, into
the unknown land where love is the only wisdom, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
where good and evil are more exactly appreciated and
understood.</p>

<p>After once looking at her, and the first shock of
reverence and pain over, he remained gazing thus;
hearing the throbbing in his own temples and the rush
of the blood in his veins, like the roar of an internal tide.</p>

<p>She was covered with a white robe, laid over her
limbs by pious friends, with severe purity. Ample folds
lay in straight lines from her neck to her feet, broken
only by the marble hands which held a crucifix. A
semi-transparent veil was over her face, neither concealing
it nor too plainly revealing the outline, but letting
it be seen vaguely, remotely as it were, through a
mist of clouds, like the image that survives from a
dream in eyes but half-awake. He would have liked
to see more clearly what remained of her unequalled
beauty, which, under the hand of death, was fading
like some withered violet-tinted flower. In that face,
blind and dead as it was, there was still some trace of
expression. Leon found himself gazing into the depths
of that vacant mystery, made deeper by the clouds of
gauze, and recognised the look he had last seen on her
features&mdash;a look less of love than of irony.</p>

<p>His brain was busy with all the solemn thoughts
that besiege a man in the great crises of life: he reflected
on the wide distance that divides us from true
happiness&mdash;a distance that mind cannot measure, and
that man has no means of shortening. Suddenly his
meditations were interrupted by a commonplace and
intrusive sound&mdash;a cough. He looked round. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
and the dead were not alone. In a corner of the
chapel sat a watcher. It was the little priest, seated
on a bench with his eyes fixed on his prayer-book.
Leon could not help admiring the fidelity of the spiritual
friend who, having been her guide during life, had
constituted himself her guardian in death. Without
lifting his head, the Italian raised his eyes and looked
for a few seconds at Leon fixedly&mdash;very fixedly.
Then he looked down again and went on reading.
This simple, calm drooping of the eyes was expressive
of the most sovereign contempt imaginable. Paoletti
murmured on, as though not a soul were present:
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego sum vermis et non homo, opprobium hominum et
abjectio plebis.</i>”</p>

<p>Why was it that, as he left the chapel&mdash;no less
reverently than he had entered it&mdash;Leon felt in his
soul a soothing sense of consolation?&mdash;He had seen,
face to face the worst terrors of the moral and physical
world, and the struggle to which the contemplation
had given rise had left his soul surrounded by melancholy
ruins. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Impavidum ferient ruinae</i>, as a heathen
said! But though he was crushed, alone, exiled and
injustly judged, what could he care while his conscience
was free in the sunshine that brightens it when it is sure
of having acted rightly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On returning to his empty house he found his servant
busy packing in obedience to his orders given a
few hours since. The man expressed great joy at seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
him, and when Leon enquired as to the cause of
his eager satisfaction, the faithful fellow replied:</p>

<p>“At the Señora Marquesa’s, and in all the houses
where you are known, they said you would be brought
home with a bullet through your brains to-night. They
were so sure of it that I could not help crying.”</p>

<p>Leon smiled sadly.</p>

<p>“And so, when I came in to pack, the first thing I
did was to hide your pistols, in case you should kill
yourself here if you had not done it before.”</p>

<p>“Where have you put them? Are they loaded?”
said Leon hastily.</p>

<p>“Oh! Master, do not kill yourself!” cried the terrified
man.</p>

<p>“Nay, be easy, my friend,” said Leon pointing to
his forehead. “This brain is not bent on suicide.&mdash;As
to the pistols, if they are loaded you had better
drop them into the street, for the first fool to experiment
upon.”</p>

<p>“Throw them away! They are beauties!”</p>

<p>“Well, keep them yourself then; keep them till you
marry.”</p>

<p>“You forget, Sir; I am married.”</p>

<p>“Well then, till you are a widower.”</p>

Taylor</b>, from the German by Mary J. Safford, in one vol.
Paper, 50 cts. Cloth, 90 cts.</p>

<div class="deco2"> </div>

<div class="ads2">
<p>“One of the most thoughtful, feeling, and at the same time
scholarly romances yet translated from the treasury of German
literature. Although the story is laid in the midst of a Roman
emperor’s court, it touches only a few characters, and those not
of the higher and more aristocratic class. Located amidst scenes
of almost fabulous wealth and extravagance, the story is severely
simple in style; and although the author describes with the zeal
of a well-informed archæologist the wonders of Rome and the
enormous expenditures of Hadrian in architecture and landscape-manufacturing,
there is no excess in the language which places
these before us. The most remarkable thing about the book is
that no love-making or love intrigues are found in its pages. In
this respect it is even more unique than ‘John Inglesant.’ But
like that romance its chief interest rests on the contrast of
religious opinions. The age was one of change and doubt. The
ancient cults of Rome and Greece had wholly lost their hold upon
the minds of thinking men. Christianity, although not yet free
from persecution, was gaining a wider influence, as men turned
away dissatisfied from the ideal of their fathers and found in the
spiritual religion of the despised Nazarene a comfort and a solace
which no external rites could convey. It is the contrast between
the subtle spiritual element and the various forms of idolatry
adopted by Rome and Egypt, that constitutes the strength and
fascination of this book.”&mdash;<cite>Utica Herald.</cite></p>

<p>“The story of Antinous lends itself easily to philosophical
romance: a hero who could be made unhappy but not corrupt by
an emperor&mdash;who remained faithful to Hadrian after he had
ceased to honor him, not from self-interest, but because in soothing
the nerves of an imperial invalid, he added to the comfort of
the world; and who sacrificed his life at last for a benefactor
whom he no longer loved&mdash;is a hero such as is rarely found in
literature.”&mdash;<cite>The Critic, N. Y.</cite></p>

<p>“It has to the full that strange glamour which lends to
romances their peculiar charm, and in many respects is comparable
to Kingsley’s ‘Hypatia.’”&mdash;<cite>Yale Literary Magazine.</cite></p>

in one vol. Paper, 50 cts. Cloth, 90 cts.</p>

<div class="deco2"> </div>

<p>“If report may be trusted ‘George Taylor,’ though
writing in German, is an Englishman by race, and not
merely by the assumption of a pseudonym. The statement
is countenanced by the general physiognomy of
his novels, which manifest the artistic qualities in which
German fiction, when extending beyond the limits of a
short story, is usually deficient. ‘Antinous’ was a remarkable
book; ‘Clytia’ displays the same talent, and
is, for obvious reasons, much better adapted for general
circulation. Notwithstanding its classical title, it is a
romance of the post-Lutheran Reformation in the second
half of the sixteenth century. The scene is laid
in the Palatinate; the hero, Paul Laurenzano, is, like
John Inglesant, the pupil, but, unlike John Inglesant,
the proselyte and emissary, of the Jesuits, who send him
to do mischief in the disguise of a Protestant clergyman.
He becomes confessor to a sisterhood of reformed
nuns, as yet imperfectly detached from the old
religion and forms the purpose of reconverting them.
During the process, however, he falls in love with one
of their number, the beautiful Clytia, the original, Mr.
Taylor will have it, of the lovely bust in whose genuineness
he will not let us believe. Clytia, as is but reasonable,
is a match for Loyola; the man in Laurenzano
overpowers the priest, and, after much agitation of
various kinds, the story concludes with his marriage. It
is an excellent novel from every point of view, and, like
‘Antinous’ gives evidence of superior culture and
thoughtfulness.”&mdash;<cite>The London Saturday Review.</cite></p>

<p class="hi break"><b>THE DEVIL’S PORTRAIT.</b>&mdash;By <b>Anton Giulio
Barrili</b>, from the Italian by Evelyn Wodehouse, in one
vol. Paper, 40 cents. Cloth, 75 cents.</p>

<div class="deco2"> </div>


<p>“The wide and terrible limits of Italian tragedy
have seldom been filled out with a rounder measure
than in this powerful but melancholy romance of the
14th century. It is a romance of art and passion; the
art which made the walls of old churches glow with
frescoes before which the world now stands to study
and admire, and the passion which not only loves and
adores, but which hates and destroys. It is a romance
not only of the brush but of the dagger.</p>

<p>“The scene is laid in Arezzo in the Val di Chiana.
The town is small, with wide, clean, small, and well-paved
streets, possesses many celebrated works of art,
has a bishop, two inns, and a café, and women who are
passing fair. Among the women is Fiordalisa, the
daughter of the painter Jacopo, a disciple of the school
of Taddeo Gaddi. Ever since she had come with her
father from Florence, where she was born, to live at
Arezzo, she has been acknowledged as a peerless
beauty. These are the warm colors, borrowed from the
world about him, in which the Italian novelist paints her:</p>

<div class="ads2">

<p>“‘Good God! how beautiful she looked there, twice... with
her eyes cast down, and her head and throat jealously guarded by
a veil of white silk flowing over her shoulders. Dressed simply
in a robe of some half-woollen, half-silken stuff, made with loose
sleeves, and large folds descending gracefully from her hips: a
white kerchief just covering the nape of her neck, but no other
trimming or superfluous adornment to disguise the curves of her
perfect form, Madonna Fiordalisa seemed a very miracle of grace
and beauty. The head crowned with chestnut tresses, and the
profile of that delicately-tinted face, both displayed such purity of
outline, combined with such sweetness of expression, that it
seemed to Spinello that he had never before beheld anything to
compare with them.’”&mdash;<cite>Literary World, Boston.</cite></p>

<div class="ads2">
<p>“If Italian literature includes any more such unique and
charming stories as this one, it is to be hoped that translators will
not fail to discover them to the American public. The ‘Eleventh
Commandment’ deals with a variety of topics&mdash;the social intrigues
necessary to bring about preferment in political life, a communal
order, an adventurous unconventional heiress, and her acquiescent,
good-natured uncle, and most cleverly are the various elements
combined, the whole forming an excellent and diverting little story.
The advent of a modern Eve in the masculine paradise (?) established
at the Convent of San Bruno is fraught with weighty consequences,
not only to the individual members of the brotherhood,
but to the well-being of the community itself. The narrative of
M’lle Adela’s adventures is blithely told, and the moral deducible
therefrom for men is that, on occasion, flight is the surest method

<div class="ads2">

<p>“If ‘The Eleventh Commandment,’ the previous work of
Barrili, was a good three-act play, ‘A Whimsical Wooing’ is a
sparkling comedietta. It is one situation, a single catastrophe, yet,
like a bit of impressionist painting of the finer sort, it reveals in a
flash all the possibilities of the scene. The hero, Roberto Fenoglio,
a man of wealth, position, and accomplishments, finds himself at
the end of his resources for entertainment or interest. Hopelessly
bored, he abandons himself to the drift of chance, and finds himself,
in no longer space of time than from midnight to daylight&mdash;where
and how, the reader will thank us for not forestalling his
pleasure in finding out for himself.”&mdash;<cite>The Nation, New York.</cite></p>

<p>“‘A Whimsical Wooing’ is the richly-expressive title under
which ‘Clara Bell’ introduces a cleverly-narrated episode by
Anton Giulio Barrili to American readers. It is a sketch of Italian
life, at once rich and strong, but nevertheless discreet in sentiment
and graceful in diction. It is the old story of the fallacy of trusting
to a proxy in love matters.”&mdash;<cite>Boston Post.</cite></p>

Marchesa Colombi</b>, from the Italian by Clara Bell, in
one vol. Paper cover, 50 cts., Cloth binding, 90 cts.</p>

<div class="deco2"> </div>

<div class="ads2">
<p>“If this is a fair specimen of the work of the Marchesa Colombi,
she is assuredly entitled to a high place among the novelists of
the day. The scene of the story is laid in a little village in the
north of Italy where lives the ‘Dottorino,’ as he is called, the
village doctor, a gross, ignorant man, but with a gift for a certain
sort of humor and graceful flattery which make him a welcome
guest at the table of the rich Signor Pedrotti. The novel is chiefly
concerned with the doctor’s son, Giovanni, whose infancy under
the care of a stupid yet wholly devoted servant, La Matta, is portrayed
with inimitable pathos and humor. As he grows up,
Pedrotti becomes, in a sense, his patron. But the lad has met
Pedrotti’s daughter, Rachel, and his love being reciprocated he
determines to attain wealth and fame that he may win her father’s
consent to their marriage. Pedrotti treats the proposal with utter
contempt and shuts the door in his face. The youth pledges his
love anew to Rachel, who promises to wait for him, and he then
goes to Milan, where after a dreary struggle with poverty he becomes
a celebrated advocate, rich as well as famous. But absence
dims his ideal and the blandishments of a beautiful countess drive
the image of Rachel for a time from his thoughts.</p>

<div class="ads2">

<p>“He had started in live in extreme poverty but with a great love
in his heart; and the goal he had set before his eyes was wealth and
distinction, but still for the sake of love. Now, wealth and distinction
were his&mdash;but the love he had lost on the way.</p>
</div>



<p>“The closing part of the story tells how, actuated by a sense of
duty rather than of love, he goes back to the little village to
claim the hand of the woman who has waited for him so long.
The ending is written with remarkable power and stamps the
book with a quality closely akin to greatness. All the characters
are strongly individualized; the author’s humor is spontaneous
and delightful; and on every page there is displayed a subtle
knowledge of the human heart and of the fatal consequences of
ignoble motives which, in spite of some unpleasant episodes, renders
<cite>The Wane of an Ideal</cite> as wholesome morally as it is artistically
effective and complete.”&mdash;<cite>The Literary World.</cite></p>

two vols. Paper, $1.00. Cloth, $1.75.</p>

<div class="deco2"> </div>

<div class="ads2">
<p>“We owe to Eckstein the brilliant romance of ‘Quintus
Claudius,’ which Clara Bell has done well to translate for us, for
it is worthy of place beside the Emperor of Ebers and the Aspasia
of Hamerling. It is a story of Rome in the reign of Domitian,
and the most noted characters of the time figure in its pages,
which are a series of picturesque descriptions of Roman life and
manners in the imperial city, and in those luxurious retreats at
Baiae and elsewhere to which the wealthy Romans used to retreat
from the heats of summer. It is full of stirring scenes in the
streets, in the palaces, in the temples, and in the amphitheatre,
and the actors therein represent every phase of Roman character,
from the treacherous and cowardly Domitian and the vile Domitia
down to the secret gatherings of the new sect and their exit from
life in the blood-soaked sands of the arena, where they were torn
in pieces by the beasts of the desert. The life and the manners
of all classes at this period were never painted with a bolder
pencil than by Eckstein in this masterly romance, which displays
as much scholarship as invention.”&mdash;<cite>Mail and Express, N. Y.</cite></p>

<p>“These neat volumes contain a story first published in German.
It is written in that style which Ebers has cultivated so successfully.
The place is Rome; the time, that of Domitian at the end
of the first century. The very careful study of historical data, is
evident from the notes at the foot of nearly every page. The
author attempted the difficult task of presenting in a single story
the whole life of Rome, the intrigues of that day which compassed
the overthrow of Domitian, and the deep fervor and terrible trials
of the Christians in the last of the general persecutions. The
court, the army, the amphitheatre, the catacombs, the evil and
the good of Roman manhood and womanhood&mdash;all are here.
And the work is done with power and success. It is a book for
every Christian and for every student, a book of lasting value,
bringing more than one nation under obligation to its author.”&mdash;<cite>New

by <b>Ernst Eckstein</b>, from the German by Clara Bell.
Authorized edition. In two vols. Paper, $1.00. Cloth, $1.75.</p>

<div class="deco2"> </div>


<div class="ads2">
<p>“The date of ‘Prusias’ is the latter half of the first century
B. C. Rome is waging her tedious war with Mithridates. There
are also risings in Spain, and the home army is badly depleted.
Prusias comes to Capua as a learned Armenian, the tutor of a
noble pupil in one of the aristocratic households. Each member
of this circle is distinct. Some of the most splendid traits of
human nature develop among these grand statesmen and their
dignified wives, mothers, and daughters. The ideal Roman maiden
is Psyche; but she has a trace of Greek blood and of the native
gentleness. Of a more interesting type is Fannia, who might,
minus her slaves and stola, pass for a modern and saucy New York
beauty. Her wit, spirit, selfishness, and impulsive magnanimity
might easily have been a nineteenth-century evolution. In the
family to which Prusias comes are two sons, one of military leanings,
the other a student. Into the ear of the latter Prusias whispers
the real purpose of his coming to Italy. He is an Armenian
and in league with Mithridates for the reduction of Roman rule.
The unity which the Senate has tried to extend to the freshly-conquered
provinces of Italy is a thing of slow growth. Prusias by
his strategy and helped by Mithridates’s gold, hopes to organize
slaves and disaffected provincials into a force which will oblige
weakened Rome to make terms, one of which shall be complete
emancipation and equality of every man before the law. His harangues
are in lofty strain, and, save that he never takes the coarse,
belligerent tone of our contemporaries, these speeches might have
been made by one of our own Abolitionists. The one point that
Prusias never forgets is personal dignity and a regal consideration
for his friends. But after all, this son of the gods is befooled by
a woman, a sinuous and transcendently ambitious Roman belle,
the second wife of the dull and trustful prefect of Capua; for
this tiny woman had all men in her net whom she found it useful
to have there.</p>

<p>“The daughter of the prefect&mdash;hard, homely-featured, and hating
the supple stepmother with an unspeakable hate, tearing her
beauty at last like a tigress and so causing her death&mdash;is a repulsive
but very strong figure. The two brothers who range themselves
on opposite sides in the servile war make another unforgettable
picture; and the beautiful slave Brenna, who follows her
noble lover into camp, is a spark of light against the lurid background.
The servile movement is combined with the bold plans
of the Thracian Spartacus. He is a good figure and perpetually
surprises us with his keen foresight and disciplinary power.</p>

full of the fibre and breath of its century.” <cite>Boston Ev’g Transcript.</cite></p>

enough to please the most jaded novel reader. The character of
schoolmaster Heinzius would alone make the reputation of a new

by his statuary in Miletus, and won at the same time the love of
Cydippe, the daughter of Charidemus, the archon of the city. It
is a simple story, which Eckstein has to tell, a story which has
been told in all lands and tongues ever since there were young
people in the world, and they were in the habit of loving each
other; but there must be something in it after all, for as he tells
it, it seems to have happened yesterday, and not further away

makes the whole work kin, and which puts back the clock of time
until its hands touch the dead and gone centuries. Acontius and
Cydippe may have lived and died twenty-three hundred years ago,
as Eckstein tells us, but we doubt it, for reading his glowing and
picturesque pages we feel that they are alive and exempt from
death, as exempt as Paris and Helen, Romeo and Juliet, or that
pair of pure and happy lovers, Porphyry and Madeline. The

<p>“We have read his work conscientiously, and, we confess, with
profit. Never have we had so clear an insight into the manners,
thoughts, and feelings of the ancient Greeks. No study has made
us so familiar with the age of Pericles. We recognize throughout
that the author is master of the period of which he treats. Moreover,
looking back upon the work from the end to the beginning,

<p>“Hamerling’s Aspasia, herself the most beautiful woman in
all Hellas, is the apostle of beauty and of joyousness, the implacable
enemy of all that is stern and harsh in life. Unfortunately,
morality is stern, and had no place among Aspasia’s doctrines.
This ugly fact, Landor has thrust as far into the background as
possible. Hamerling obtrudes it. He does not moralize, he
neither condemns nor praises; but like a fate, silent, passionless,
and resistless, he carries the story along, allows the sunshine for
a time to silver the turbid stream, the butterflies and gnats to flutter

of his experience, which will be gratefully received by all
rosarians. Mr. Hole is an enthusiast, and he communicates much
of that quality to his pages. It is impossible to read long in this
charming volume without becoming impressed with a profound
conviction that a rose is the most perfect thing in creation. Aside
from its value as a guide to cultivators, whether professional or
amateur, the work possesses a rare fascination, that partly belongs
to the subject and partly to its happy manner of treatment. There
is a vein of playful humor in Mr. Hole’s writing that rarely degenerates
into flippancy, and occasionally a little flight of sentimentalism
that accords well with his theme, mingling agreeably
enough with the purely scientific disquisitions like a wholesome
perfume, which is happily not a hot-house, but an out-of-door one.
We cordially commend this book to all who are interested in the
cultivation of the queen of flowers.”&mdash;<cite>Chicago Evening Journal.</cite></p>

<p>“The whole volume teems with encouraging data and statistics;
and, while it is intensely practical, it will interest general readers
by an unfailing vivacity, which supplies garnish and ornament to
the array of facts, and furnishes ‘ana’ in such rich profusion that
one might do worse than lay by many of Mr. Hole’s good stories
for future table-talk.”&mdash;<cite>Saturday Review.</cite></p>

<p>“It is the production of a man who boasts of thirty ‘all England’
cups, whose Roses are always looked for anxiously at
flower-shows, who took the lion’s share in originating the first
Rose-Show <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pur et simple</i>, whose assistance as judge or <i>amicus
curiae</i> is always courted at such exhibitions. Such a man ‘ought
to have something to say worth hearing to those who love the
Rose,’ and he <em>has</em> said it.”&mdash;<cite>Gardeners’ Chronicle.</cite></p>

<p>“A very captivating book, containing a great deal of valuable
information about the Rose and its culture, given in a style which
can not fail to please.”&mdash;<cite>Journal of Horticulture.</cite></p>

<p class="hi break"><b>A TRAGEDY AT CONSTANTINOPLE.</b>&mdash;By
<b>Leila-Hanoum</b>, translated from the French, with notes,
by <b>Gen. R. E. Colston</b>, one vol. pa., 50 cts. Clo., 90 cts.</p>

<div class="deco2"> </div>

<div class="ads2">

<p>“The romance has for its groundwork the mysterious and
fascinating subject of harem life in the East, and is founded on
facts. The tragedy is one no less thrilling in culmination than
the violent ending of the Sultan Abdul-Aziz, which startled the
world only a few years ago. The author works her way to this
climax by a narrative almost as strange as a chapter out of the
Arabian Nights. Incidentally it falls to her lot to reveal the
secrets of the harems so jealously guarded from observation. She
seems to have enjoyed inside views of those shrouded places to
an extent rare if not unprecedented among persons not actually
inmates of them. At all events no work surpasses this in its disclosures
of the deep shadows of that female slavery which remains
the foulest blot upon the domestic institutions of Turkey. The
Empress Eugénie, Midhat-Pasha, Reshid-Pasha, Hassan-Bey,
and other personages of rank and power in their day, are among
the characters who play their part in this extraordinary book.
General R. E. Colston, long identified with the Egyptian Army,
is the translator, and supplies a preface so good that it should not
be skipped.”&mdash;<cite>The Journal of Commerce, New York.</cite></p>

<p>“It is a translation from the French by Leila-Hanoum, by
Gen. R. E. Colston, late Bey on the General Staff, Egyptian
Army, who thinks (and we agree with him) that it will give the
readers a more complete idea of the Mussulman than he could
obtain by wading through volumes of mere description. What
the novels of Georg Ebers are to the life of ancient Egypt and
Rome, and the stories of Galdós are to the life of Spain, the
Tragedy in the Imperial Harem is to the life of Turkey, as revealed
in the luxuriant, indolent idleness of the Sultan and in the endless
intrigues of his Pashas and Beys, and as concealed (at least
from the eye of the Giaour) in the stifling recesses of the seraglio.
It is a story of love and vengeance, the love and the vengeance of
harem life running like a black thread through the tawdry splendor
of two generations, and shooting its stains along the web and
woof of other lives than those of the sufferers. If it reminds us
of anything, it is of the early romantic work of Byron, who was
the first Englishman whom the East really inspired, and who
painted with singular poetic power the dark unbridled passion of
its souls of fire&mdash;‘with whom revenge was virtue.’ We have in
the Tragedy in the Imperial Harem a prose-poem of striking interest,
and of permanent value, as a picture of Eastern manners.”&mdash;<cite>The

<div class="ads2">

<p>“Spanish is not under any circumstances a difficult language
to learn. It has in its construction and pronunciation an encouraging
directness very unlike the grammatical involutions of German
and the delicate sound-shadings of French. Working in accordance
with the rules of almost any ‘system,’ a diligent student can
in a very little while acquire a fair mastery of the language; though
it is true that some of the ‘systems’ are much more difficult than
others. One of the simplest and best of them all is ‘A Practical
Method for Learning Spanish,’ by Señor A. Ramos Diaz de
Villegas, just now published by William S. Gottsberger, New York.
The ‘method’ of Señor de Villegas comprehends a collection of
anecdotes arranged in short lines with an English translation,
similarly arranged, on the corresponding opposite page; familiar
phrases, with idiomatic renderings in English in parallel columns;
a vocabulary of words in common use, and a complete list of the
Spanish irregular verbs. It will be observed that this method
hardly can be called original; that it is more or less that of Morales,
of Velazquez, of Prendergast, and that some of its features are
found in Ollendorff and in Ahn; but in simplicity of arrangement
and directness of purpose it is superior to all of these&mdash;Prendergast
possibly excepted. It certainly is what it is called&mdash;a practical
method for learning Spanish. With a relatively small outlay of
mental exertion it produces exceptionally good results.”&mdash;<cite>Philadelphia
Times, June 24, 1882.</cite></p>

<p>This Method is based on the principles of modern
philosophy. Gradual progress and spontaneous development
are its leading features. The sentence is the unit.
Natural language precedes literary language. The example
teaches the rule; language teaches grammar.</p>

<p>The work is printed entirely in the Roman character.</p>

<div class="ads2">
<p>“<em>Spoken language is to written language what the real object is
to its description.</em></p>

<p>“The knowledge of language is based on sound. Sound is
the soul of language; without it language is dead. Sound imparts
life; vividly and forcibly it impresses <em>facts</em> upon the mind, and
<em>facts</em> are the <em>absolute basis</em> of <em>all</em> knowledge. <em>No true, no real
knowledge</em> of language has ever been attained, unless it was
founded on this solid basis which <em>the living voice</em> alone has the
power to create.</p>

<p>“The study of language must conform to the process of nature.
Language was spoken many ages before letters or books were
even thought of, and no one ever attempted to read or write his
mother-tongue before he was able to understand and to speak it.
<em>To go counter to the sequence in which the faculties naturally and
spontaneously develop, is to oppose the precepts of nature. We must
understand a language before we can speak it; we must speak a
language before we can read it.</em> <em>Reading</em> is indirect <em>hearing</em>. In
reading we mentally <em>pronounce</em> the author’s words and these
mental <em>sounds</em> are reported to the brain. If we cannot <em>pronounce</em>,
we cannot <em>read</em>. When we begin to read our mother-tongue, we
recall to our mind <em>known</em> sounds and <em>known</em> ideas. Must the
process not be the same when we begin to read a foreign tongue?
To make reading <em>the starting-point</em> in the acquisition of a foreign
language is contrary to reason and the student, after fruitless
efforts, invariably abandons his task.”&mdash;<cite>Extract from Author’s
